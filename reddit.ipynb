Godspeed to anyone who reads any sentence of this.\\n\\n[here is the last post for context (?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u2csl0/crispest_water_on_campus/)\\n\\nArmed with the curated list of the recommendations of the last post, i put on my urban hiking (aka gentrified walking) playlist and I tried the crispest fountains of youth this campus cradles.\\n\\nMethodology:\\n\\nI condensed the list to only include potable water sources. I didn't try blackwell, because I don't know anyone who lives there and i am not trying to trespass. Further, I excluded the recommendation of the gym fountain, because I have an intensity about me that I fear would turn me into a gym bro if I set foot in a gym. I do not wish this fate upon myself so I am guarding my feeble sanctity by not crossing the gym line. Next, I opted for a non insulated metal water bottle so that leftover chill from previous water fountains could not influence the taste of the next water fountain in the case fountains were tried consecutively.\\n\\nAt this point we reach a Shakespearean impasse: to spit or to swallow, that is the question. Whether ‚Äòtis nobler to only taste the water fountain or to become bloated from all the water I consume in one day trying to hit up all the fountains. Normally when faced with this impasse, I gargle. You would be surprised how little liquid it takes to gargle. However, for the sake of science I chose to swallow all of the water I tasted.\\n\\nImportantly, fountains were tried on different days. Peer reviewers have pointed out this weakness in the methodology. However, a good fountain will consistently spit good crisp fluids into the crevices of a bottle even if there was no other water bottle filling action before the current fill, so the day of fill should not impact the crispness of water.\\n\\nScoring: **Anxiety (A)** was scored out of 2 (0 being please let the hot light of god shine upon me so that I may evaporate from this dreadful world and 2 being luxuriating in comfort). Anxiety noted the fearsome echo of the water bottle fill in comparison to a quite yet populated environment, general amount of people around (I don‚Äôt like having more than one person looking at me at any given moment), and if any worrisome leaks surrounded the fountain.\\n\\n**Beauty (B)** was scored out of 3. Beauty includes any general aesthetics surrounding the fountain experience.\\n\\n**Crispness (C)** was the main scoring factor which is only fair given the list‚Äôs method of curation. As is such, crispness was scored out of 10. Crispness includes freshness of taste and bone chilling temperatures. I wanted the water to transport me to Antarctica so vividly that I could remember if Antarctica was at the bottom or top of the globe.\\n\\n14. The opulent vlsb fountain: 4 = A: 1, B: 3, C: 0\\n\\nI could make tea with this tepid water.\\n\\n13. 4th floor of etch to the right when exiting the main elevator: 5 = A: 2, B: 1, C: 2\\n\\nThe only thing i can say is that thankfully with time this water will end up in the toilet where it belongs. Disliked! Blocked!\\n\\n12. Cory hall fountain near supernode: 7 = A:-1, B: 4, C: 4\\n\\nFear of eecs peoples societal superiority over a shivering social science girlie factored into anxiety. However, I confuse fear and admiration, so my type is eecs boys. The raw Chad eecs energy that made me scared of being hurt boosted the beauty ranking (i recommend texting that sentiment of being scared of being hurt to a pretty eecs goat with an accidental mullet at 1am so that you can speed run your feral phase. Oops lol sorry). These two biases balance out each other as a net neutral in the score. Controversially, I believe the water itself is actually overhyped.\\n\\n11. first floor physics north and 3rd floor at the end of the hall: 7 = A: 2, B: 1, C: 4\\n\\nYou could go through the trouble of measuring the temperature of this water in kelvin only to find it is room temperature\\n\\n10. asuc near amazon storefront: 7.1 = A: 1.8, B: 1, C: 4.3\\n\\ni had to deduct from the anxiety ranking since my shoes for crews non-slip new balances sounded like spongebob squeaky boots walking to the fountain. Though, it sure was water.\\n\\n9. 3rd floor of doe library by art history/classics: 7.3 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 2.3\\n\\nWith the amount of noise this fountain was making i expected water so cold even sigma freud would have penis envy of this spout. Yet i received nothing of the sort.\\n\\n8. Gianni hall: 8 = A: 2, B: 2, C: 4\\n\\nhell is colder than this water\\n\\n7. kroeber hall fountain, first floor: 8 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 3\\n\\npeople who use sensodyne toothpaste will enjoy the water of this fountain. I don‚Äôt and did not enjoy this fountain. Though, I enjoyed the house posts.\\n\\n6. Evans ground floor: 10 = A: 0, B: 0, C: 10\\n\\nLovely as always, despite being in a building so bad even the university wants to tear it down.\\n\\n5. campbell hall 1st and 5th floor: 12.2 = A: 1, B: 2, C: 9.2\\n\\nThe fifth floor is marginally better than the first floor. The fifth floor is so fresh that I felt like an Alaskan salmon swimming upstream against all the tasks i should be doing. Unfortunately, the salmon imagery for which this water transported me made me afraid as we live on a campus full of bears. Bears fish salmon. For this reason, this is an anxiety inducing fountain\\n\\n4. stanley hall / the bottle filler next to yali‚Äôs qualcam cafe: 12.8 = A: 2, B: 2, C: 8.8\\n\\nI shivered.\\n\\n3. Haas faculty: 13 = A: 2, B: 1, C:10\\n\\nThe sheer crispness of the water animorphed me into a polar bear. For this reason, I recommend this fountain for furries\\n\\n2. mcCone hall, 5th floor west side: 14 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 9\\n\\nright by a very beautiful patio view. I saw a berkeley squirrel (from afar) which coincidentally is the largest mammal i think i could confidently vanquish with my bare hands in a fight (now give me a sturdy stick and i could take on all the tigers at the Oakland zoo at once).\\n\\n1. Morrison music hall: 15 = A: 2, B: 3, C:10\\n\\nThe parade people who have drank from this fountain have worn a pale yellow oval into the tiles just in front of it. You can imagine them standing in the center of the worn out tile oval filling up their water bottle; and you can imagine all the people to come doing the same, making the oval a little paler. You can do all this imaging while you know that in the present you are filling up your bottle standing in that same oval. That worn out tile was the first time that I saw like the tralfamadorians. And so I thought, maybe I should read Slaughterhouse-Five again. That or maybe i should just touch grass and let this stupid hobby of reviewing waterfountains die. So it goes.\\n\\nUpdate of the update: they moved the elkay from the left to the right fountain in morrison hall. Therefore morrison hall water is no longer fire. This list remains in place but be cautioned that fountains may have changed.\",\n",

       "  '(Re-posted from the CS161 piazza)\\n\\nAs you are undoubtedly aware, there is now a very high probability that the University\\'s lecturers will be on strike on Wednesday the 17th and Thursday the 18th.  As one such lecturer I\\'m faced with a difficult decision.  I\\'m personally treated well, and the reason I do this job is to serve my students.  So I feel like I\\'m betraying you if I strike.\\n\\nBut I\\'ve decided: I will be on strike if one occurs. \\n\\nSo if there is a strike lecture will be formally cancelled on Wednesday the 17th.  I will still be in the zoom room however, and available for any questions people have about the strike, the larger context, and other issues.  And on Thursday I\\'ll probably be walking the picket line itself at Bancroft & Telegraph.\\n\\nBut some background as to why I feel the need to join the strike:\\n\\nThe EECS department individually treats lecturers like me well: we are effectively considered part of the faculty (unlike some other departments) and our pay is reasonable (aka high by lecturer standards, although low by say \"police investigator\" standards). If you are curious, everybody\\'s salary is public and available at https://transparentcalifornia.com/ .\\n\\nBut how the department can treat us is often constrained by the larger university, and the larger university seriously neglects the lecturers.\\n\\nAt Berkeley, 40% of the student credit/hours (that is, actual teaching, you know, the thing that we are supposed to be doing.) is done by lecturers.  Yet we represent <20% of the academic payroll costs (excluding the cost of administrators and coaches!  So just the cost of professors etc).  And this is skewed in two ways: \\n\\nThere are a few Haas lecturers that are paid very well and the EECS department, which is currently teaching a huge fraction of our undergraduate population, has less reliance on lecturers than some other departments as we actually have a few teaching professors and most of our faculty will do one large class a year.  So I suspect that \"40% of the teaching, <20% of the pay\" is really closer to 50% of the teaching and <15% of the pay when you exclude these two outliers, but I haven\\'t run the numbers to confirm that.\\n\\nSo for the larger health of the University it is clear they have to treat those who are actually performing the University\\'s stated mission better.\\n\\nAnd even I, arguably amongst the best situated lecturers in the University, find that the University\\'s mistreatment is frustrating to say the least.  What the University considers a \"full time\" teaching load for a lecturer is just ridiculously high.  As an example, the University initially insisted that co-teaching both CS161 (~450 students) and CS61C (~1000 students) together is only a 60% time job.  Fortunately the department\\'s bureaucratic ninjas were able to fix that incident, but it is symptomatic of a larger problem.  Apparently the University think the time it takes to teach a 20 student class and a 1000 student class is effectively the same, that all our effort is O(1) as a function of class size.  I wish.\\n\\nSo yes, I\\'ll be supporting the lecturer strike.  If a strike happens (now looking highly likely) lecture on Wednesday will be cancelled but I\\'ll be in the zoom room for anyone who wants to talk about this situation and other related issues.',\n",

       "  '# Introduction\\n### Motivations\\n\\nI wrote this constructive critique to motivate CS70 and other similarly dense and not beginner friendly material courses to follow suit in the suggestions I give. CS70 staff likely know who I am and if you would like to have a more in-depth discussion, please feel free to reach out :)\\n\\n### Establishing Credibility/Reputability\\n\\nTo preface: I have (and when I say this, I‚Äôm not exaggerating) studied on average ~10hrs every single day of this entire semester. From 1/18 till 5/12, I have spent approximately 900 hours on CS70 alone, which doesn‚Äôt include office hours or discussions or CSM sections. I go to 4 discussions per week (2 different TAs) and I always stay late to ask questions. Additionally, I attend 2 CSM sections per week, I go to OH every day, I have a tutor, post on Piazza and Discord anytime I‚Äôm confused, and I spend my entire day from start to finish in the library studying JUST 70. Think I‚Äôm overexaggerating or lying? My hours are tracked, 70 also has a log of all my OH tickets, and my discussion TAs, and OH staff can back this as well.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Why do I feel like I‚Äôm qualified to critique the course?** I have significant prior experience privately tutoring students before and have had substantial involvement in the sequencing, design, and structuring of 3 different courses as well as development of course material at my high school (internationally recognized for one of the courses). And as previously mentioned, I have followed and done everything as recommended by the course staff, Rao/Sahai, and others on how to study/‚Äùsurvive‚Äù in cs70.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#1) Overall\\n\\nLet me be very clear, this course is not equitable. In fact, this is emblematic of a much larger issue: none of the lower-divs (mainly 61A & CS70) are. In 61A alone, prior experience is the single most significant predictor of success; according to Pamela, only 15% of NPE students get a B+ or higher. In CS70, this gap is way bigger and they probably have the data to support this claim; students with prior exposure to competitive or rigorous math at any level pre-college whether it‚Äôs USAMO, USACO, AIME, AMC or multivariable/linear algebra at a local college have a MASSIVE advantage. It‚Äôs a compounding advantage because those with prior exposure need to spend less time to understand the material (the so-called ‚Äúmathematical maturity‚Äù). More precisely, their per unit of time spent has a faster rate of change (their score) versus NPE students. Lower-income students also oftentimes have to work to support themselves while in school, so the only gap-closer (spending more time on the material) is now no longer an available option. I say this as a first-gen student coming from a low-income background where the highest level of math taught at my high school is Elementary Calculus. Not everyone had the ability to take rigorous math nor was put through it. Specifically, my school only offered Integrated Math I, II, III, then ‚ÄúAP‚Äù Calc. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe course is WAY TOO FAST-PACED yet expects students to be able to reproduce every proof from a note that we read the day before. The goal of the class commonly said by Rao, Sahai, and CS70 TAs is to ‚Äúencourage learning‚Äù or to ‚Äújust learn the material and you will do fine.‚Äù This fails to acknowledge that the barrier to entry is way higher compared to 61A or 61B; **CS70 artificially inflates the difficulty of the course by intentionally creating a scarcity of resources** (or not investing time into developing resources), which I would argue is contradictory to this commonly spouted goal of ‚Äúencouraging learning.\" ‚ÄúThis is hard material‚Äù is not a sufficient excuse for poor presentation and teaching of material (both in the notes and in lecture). Furthermore, from my experience interacting with course staff in OH every single day and other mediums, it‚Äôs also clear that the hiring practices significantly prioritize grades over teaching capacity. I along with many others intentionally try to avoid certain course staff in OH because we consistently run into the same one-dimensional math comp explanations. Yes, the material is hard, but you do not have to make it any harder than it already is. \\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n#2) Lectures\\n\\nMy main point is this: the lecture should be intended as an introductory aid i.e a conceptual overview of all the main important pieces of the topic (ex: show FLT proof but not derangement, leave that for the note). This flows perfectly since notes should be used to deepen the understanding and discussion is used for application of the theory.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAn overwhelming majority of students will tell you that lecture is useless (supported by student survey data as well) and it‚Äôs motivated by a variety of factors. I will mainly address the slides i.e the presentation of material in lecture in this section. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAccording to Professor Sen, lecture slides are said to never be changed or modified in any way no matter the professor (rules by the dept apparently?). I strongly disagree and so does the educational research. Lectures should include more visual aid and more colors instead of just black, blue, red. Colors help viewers stay focused instead of getting lost in a wall of all black text. Colors and graphic images help a ton with conceptual understanding and distinguishing what‚Äôs important and what to focus on. This could be something like putting a colored box around the theorem statement to make it easy to distinguish what the overarching statement is and then the proof in a different colored box can be formatted like a step by step tutorial (literally put step 1, step 2, and what we‚Äôre doing in each step) where every little detail is pointed out. This could be something as small as writing an arrow saying that this part of the expression is to account for the cookies, and this * 2 is for symmetry since bla bla. Most importantly, stop skipping on things you consider trivial- these are things that get students stuck from minutes to hours. Common instances of this are jumping 3 steps in a proof or implicitly making a simplification that YOU consider trivial. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nSometimes, slides legitimately just don‚Äôt cut it and that‚Äôs why you have the lecturer there. They should be there to guide you through their thought process and how they approach it instead of brainlessly clicking through slides. Literally write out your steps instead of rambling out loud what the steps are- literally write it out- write out where we are, then the next step, and then the next and explain while doing it. This provides a visual aid to focus on and the exact thing to associate with the explanation coming out of the lecturer‚Äôs mouth. Again, I can not stress this enough: visually walk the viewer through the proof instead of telling it to them and then having a bunch of slides spam clicked. The reason students come to lecture is to pick up what the slides alone cannot convey and it‚Äôs the rationale for each step, the thought process, the conceptual intuitive meaning. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHere are some exemplar models of good lecturing/slides: \\n\\nA)  [Stanford‚Äôs CS70 equivalent](https://chrispiech.github.io/probabilityForComputerScientists/en/index.html)\\n\\nB) [MIT‚Äôs CS70 equivalent](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video_galleries/video-lectures/)\\n\\nC) [Alec Li CS170 notes](https://smartspot2.github.io/assets/pdf/CS170_Lecture_Notes.pdf)\\n\\n---\\n\\n#3) Notes\\n\\nThe notes are massive time sinks that are unnecessarily convoluted and overly complex for no reasons. The argument that this is how math is presented and that other courses later on will be way worse are bad cop-outs for putting in actual work into synthesizing and boiling down material into layman terms that people (undergrads) can actually understand. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe notes are literally pages and pages full of walls of black text. Add some freaking colors, box the theorem in blue, highlight the equation in red, or even something as simple as putting a visual of probability space A and B and their overlap and coloring it, or coloring the cycle of a graph. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIntentionally designing things by selectively excluding clear explanations or step-by-steps doesn‚Äôt help stimulate learning, it just confuses and angers students; for example, a visual step-by-step on how to build hypercubes and assign their bit strings instead of saying it in a one-liner in a gigantic wall of text. Why conceal information about how to deal with E[min(X, Y)] instead of explaining that you could convert it to P(X > t, Y > t)? Students don‚Äôt have unlimited time and it‚Äôs clear that our time isn‚Äôt respected; you can not reasonably expect a student to spend 30 hours on this course alone. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThese are intentional choices made to artificially make the course more difficult and arduous than it needs to be. For students who don‚Äôt have time to spare this has a disproportionately worse effect (this group tends to be lower income folks, minority groups, less privileged). \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe example of assigning bit strings on a hypercube is just one example (off the top of my head) of a concept that students routinely get confused on. If students ROUTINELY ask questions and have trouble with X topic or Y question every single semester, shouldn‚Äôt it warrant looking into? It clearly means that the explanation is not good enough. There‚Äôs a difference between trying to induce confusion to stimulate growth and a clear lack of a proper explanation. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHere are some exemplar models of good notes: \\n\\nA) [Stanford‚Äôs notes for their CS70 equivalent](https://chrispiech.github.io/probabilityForComputerScientists/en/index.html)\\n\\nB) [MIT notes for their CS70 equivalent \\\\(specific note on conditional probability\\\\)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/resources/mit6_042jf10_chap14/) \\n\\nC) [Hug Sp21 61B](https://sp21.datastructur.es)\\n\\n---\\n\\n#4) Exams / Walkthroughs / Recordings\\n\\nTo be blunt: make better solutions or make exam walkthrough videos. Potential suggestion is to have a TA make videos doing a conceptual overview of topics like Sahai did for the Sp2014 semester (can be viewed on YouTube). These short 10-15 mins videos made by Sahai and other course staff are phenomenal material that provide additional resources for students to access beyond just the notes and slides. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nExam solutions should be written like Alec Li‚Äôs Fall 2020 Final rewritten solutions. Every single step should be broken down (stop skipping steps, stop saying X is trivial, blabla) in laymen terms and how to conceptually think about it and the different ways you could approach it. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nI‚Äôve previously spoken with Tarang about past exam walkthroughs. CS70 used to do this in the past but stopped for some reason. His reasoning was that ‚Äúwe want to encourage learning,‚Äù but that is contradictory. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIf your whole goal is to encourage learning, why offer a no-HW option? If anything, by that logic then all students should be required to do the HW not only for structural/disciplinary measures but to also develop a better conceptual understanding. Clearly, this isn‚Äôt the case and by offering a no-HW option the course actively supports the testing approach which goes directly against the whole ‚Äúencourage learning‚Äù goal.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n### Other related suggestions:\\n61AB has a plethora of resources, so that even when you‚Äôre stuck you can find resources to help you get unblocked. Exam prep videos, exam prep sections, NPE sections, videos specifically about recursive runtime, or 61C‚Äôs catchup sections. In 70, you have lectures (which majority of people do not watch), notes, and in-person discussion (if you end up not being able to go, tough luck! If you forget the nitty gritty of what was covered, tough luck too!).\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe benefit of developing these materials starting now is that it will pay absolute dividends in the long-term. For example, students still watch the Enigma/Gitlet explanation videos from 61B which were made years ago. It‚Äôs not like mod arithmetic, for example, will suddenly change 20 years down the road.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHere‚Äôs what you should do: build a database of resources, reuse it semester-to-semester ‚Üí this reduces the workload of OH, TA‚Äôs, etc in the long-term and also saves on cost/time! That‚Äôs all to say that the second-order effects are huge. In fact, if the whole goal of the course, commonly said by Sahai and Rao, is to ‚Äújust learn the material‚Äù then why restrict resources to force people to interact with course staff? Why create extra barriers to resources to enforce your methodology?   \\n\\n### Suggestions:\\n* Discussion Walkthrough videos:\\n     * Data 100 releases discussion walkthroughs intentionally a week late to encourage people to go to live discussion\\n     * Ex: [Data 100 Fa19 Discussion 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CiUCgSr-Mg)\\n* Concept walkthrough videos i.e RSA, Mod Arithmetic\\n     * Ex: [61B Asymptotics Introduction](https://youtu.be/bBqfehNv7mQ)\\n     * Ex: [Sahai Mini-Lecture on Mod Arithmetic](https://youtu.be/l0DWLBX5d2A)\\n* NPE/Behind/LOST/Exam-prep Discussion sections\\n     * 61A, 61B, 61C, 189, 170, Data 100 all have some variant of these\\n* HW Walkthrough videos\\n     * Ex: [Sp14 CS70 Homework 1 Problem 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkm-YdTJjrk)\\n* HW Introductory videos:\\n     * Ex: [CS61A Fa21 HW03 Q: Num Eights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hihU9yqfndM&list=PLx38hZJ5RLZehTD4yb15G7zKmMEJDHNdn&index=3)\\n\\n---\\n#5) Teaching Pedagogy / Hiring Practices\\nThe hiring practices are based primarily on grades. While Richard has pointed out that CS70 no longer solely relies on an algorithm to assign points based on grades, it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out that most of course staff and especially readers are math comp kids. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe main reason for bringing this up is because those who come from rigorous math backgrounds or ones where they\\'ve likely competed in USAMO, USACO, AIME, AMC or taken multivar, lin alg, discrete, etc before even coming to Berkeley are gonna naturally be ones to do well in the course. Doing well in the course translates to better odds of getting hired. And funnily enough, out of the 48 cs70 course staff members who responded to the internal poll about comp math: 27 did comp math in HS, 9 did comp math but only in middle school, 12 never participated in math competitions. Now, I‚Äôm not a stats guy but that looks like an overwhelming majority to me. I want to be clear that it‚Äôs not problematic that they come from rigorous backgrounds, because I have received help from fantastic readers and TAs with a comp math background and they were great- but the flipside is that my poor experiences (as of many others) have mainly come from those with comp math backgrounds whereas I have had absolutely no issues from those without comp math background.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIt\\'s very clear that this is true when a reader/TA gives an explanation that is one-dimensional; one that is likely derived from a math comp perspective. I have routinely had poor experiences with certain readers and TAs in OH, so much so that I along with many other students try our best to avoid them. Do you know how humiliating and demeaning it is to ask for help KNOWING that the person helping you will condescendingly mock you (most of the time implicit or implied, never direct) because you value the help more than getting degraded? In 61A and 61B, asking for help never felt like I was being ridiculed or looked down on. Yet, at 70, I feel it at every step. \\n\\n###Suggestions:\\nIntroducing/encouraging course staff that comes from different backgrounds (non math comp, low rigor HS) would be a great addition. Another focus could be a better filtering mechanism. I like the approach that 61A and 61B take where you have to teach a concept to current course staff who role-play as students and ask student-like questions- teaching extends beyond just grades; someone with an B+ could be a WAY better teacher than someone who never struggled and got an A. If a course staff member feels that they communicate better over Piazza/Discord/Online, that should be a role/responsibility instead of shoveling everyone into a people-facing role which could have an adverse effect. As aforementioned in the previous section, within the content team one of the highly rated TAs responsible for those walkthroughs/recordings!\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIt is SO important that the people joining course staff are non-judgemental, welcoming, and patient. The impact that these people have on students extends beyond just learning, it goes deep and emotional.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**TL;DR: CS70 is made artificially harder by creating a scarcity of resources. The course is not equitable and heavily disadvantages minorities & lower-income students because they likely haven\\'t taken rigorous math needed and are more likely to work during school. Slides and notes have a lot of room to improve, and \"this is hard material\" isn\\'t a sufficient excuse for poor presentation. CS70 should make walkthrough videos (discussion, hw, concept, etc) and not doing so goes against their own goal of \"encouraging learning\" by restricting resources. Furthermore, hiring practices are skewed and majority of course staff come from comp math or rigorous math backgrounds, which becomes problematic when students poor experiences are a result of one-dimensional math comp explanations.**',\n",

       "  'Important Note:  This is based on my observations at Minion Level.  Theoretically the chairs and deans could do something.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe EECS department is shattering under load due to having gone from 400 graduates a year a decade ago to 1400 graduates/year now. 15% of the University is graduating in either EECS or L&S CS, a load that is breaking the department through a combination of both budgetary pressure and the grind of so many students.\\n\\nThe TL:DR is that the University formula for how teaching funds are distributed (the ‚ÄúTAS budget‚Äù) is broken.  The department gets roughly $200 for a student in a typical 4-unit class, but costs roughly $375 to hire all the TAs necessary, with the remaining $175 coming out of other departmental money.  This departmental funding comes from ‚Äúprofitable‚Äù programs (M.Eng, extension, and summer) and a portion from the University that is basically a function of the size of the faculty in the department, which clearly hasn‚Äôt scaled with demand.\\n\\nSo the EECS department is running a deficit of a few million dollars a year and the only ways to fix it are for either the University to actually fund undergraduate teaching or for EECS to drastically cut enrollment by over 50%!  And it isn‚Äôt a lot of money.  Perhaps $4-5M a year.\\n\\nBut the budget is almost an excuse.  The teaching load is ridiculous and things are failing.  If we lose one or two critical must-teach-every-semester upper division classes (e.g. 161, 186, 188, 189) we lose the undergraduate talent pipeline necessary to support 1000+ students a year in that class.  Even someone like me, who likes teaching, has grown exhausted from teaching just the same two classes on a continuous basis.\\n\\nThe department has to take drastic action.  Last year there was a rejected attempt to reduce L&S by turning it into an EECS-style freshman admission.  Since that failed there is a pending vote to cut the size of the major through the back-door.  By restricting CS70 to just those who were admitted as EECS or CS through L&S, this would cut in half the number of students who declare CS or EECS.\\n\\nThere is an asterisk in the proposal for existing L&S and non-EECS Engineering students but that is ‚Äúbudget permitting‚Äù and, as clearly visible, the budget doesn‚Äôt actually permit this.  And if the department was serious about allowing existing students they wouldn‚Äôt have capped CS70 this summer at just 200 students, since summer classes (due to their profitable nature) normally scale to support however many students wish to take a class.\\n\\nWhat does this mean?  First, nothing is official yet.  The vote result is unannounced, and even then there could be a miracle and Berkeley actually decides to fund EECS to a level necessary to meet demand.  But color me unhopeful.\\n\\nSo assuming it passes, what does it mean?\\n\\nIf you are considering Berkeley for CS starting Fall 2022 but didn‚Äôt select ‚ÄúCS‚Äù or ‚ÄúEECS‚Äù on the application form you will need to go someplace else.  I doubt any policy will protect you, and the department‚Äôs failure to communicate this already infuriates me.\\n\\nIf you were admitted as EECS or selected ‚ÄúCS‚Äù for a Letters and Science admission you should be OK.  Well, in the same sinking boat as everyone else if the department fails in maintaining the upper division.\\n\\nIf you are L&S but didn‚Äôt check ‚ÄúCS‚Äù, or a non-EECS Engineering student, it may be impossible to get into CS if you can‚Äôt get into CS70 this summer.  The only thing that can save you is if somehow the University is willing to provide enough money to actually teach the demand.\\n\\nIf the department had the funding it could possibly develop the will to continue to teach at our scale.  But since I doubt the money would ever come, there is no sense trying to cultivate the will.',\n",
       "  'In light of recent discussions on the sub, I think it\\'s a good time to discuss something that has been on my mind for years now. Here are a few sketches of my experiences at Berkeley over the last few years.\\n\\nIn my class this semester, a Chinese student was being extremely critical of the US, and after agreeing with him on many points, I finally had to say \"No country is perfect, neither the US nor China\". He responded by saying roughly that China is flawless, and US is evil. I responded by asking about the detainment and abuse of millions of muslim Uyghurs in China, to which he replies, these atrocities do not exist. Upon showing him photos and videos he said \"Ohhh you mean the education camps...\" explaining that they are for the good of the muslims in China, and that he supported this behavior.\\n\\nDuring the protests in Hong Kong, I woke up one morning, strolled through Sproul, and saw some flyers posted on a Hong Kong dedicated memorial tack-board in the plaza. I read the flyers about the atrocities committed by the CCP, and a number of Chinese students approached me and tried to convince me this was all untrue. They proceeded to remove the thoughtful artwork and anything else that was \"untrue\" from the tack-board.\\n\\nI printed some small relevant infographics of my own in response, and hung them about campus. They were all removed within the week, some replaced by pro CCP flyers, despite other political statements on other flyers remaining in tact for weeks in the same locations.\\n\\nWhy is there no consequence for students at Cal supporting genocide?\\n\\nWhy is there no respect for the memorials of friends and family detained or killed by the CCP?\\n\\nWhy doesn\\'t the university take action to prevent CCP propaganda on campus?\\n\\nHow can we solve this problem?\\n\\nEdit: It does not make sense to me that we have mandatory workshops on inclusion and diversity as students here, university wide or in classes, yet the university pays no mind when someone advocates for genocide. Is this not the ultimate form of exclusion and hatred? In general, we want to be inclusive as Americans and Cal students, but could it be our bane that we act in good faith, and include even those who hate our country?\\n\\nFor those who aren\\'t sure why we are having this conversation, here\\'s the recent video that led us here [A Hong Kong student at Cornell University got assaulted by a Mandarin-speaking student for posting up signs that say \"Free Hong Kong\" and \"Free Uyghurs\". The assault left a cut on his left hand.](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/v8qg7l/a_hong_kong_student_at_cornell_university_got/)\\n\\nHere\\'s the sort of thing that I witnessed and described above [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dddsj7/guy\\\\_tears\\\\_down\\\\_hong\\\\_kong\\\\_humanitarian\\\\_fliers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dddsj7/guy_tears_down_hong_kong_humanitarian_fliers/)\\n\\nClarification:\\n\\n1. I am not conflating Chinese students with supporters of CCP atrocities, it seems the majority of comments from both Chinese and presumably other students understand this.\\n2. In response to all of the \"read the constitution, you can\\'t outlaw free speech\" posts: I never suggested speech be outlawed, nor has any comment that I have read.\\n3. I think the point is summed up nicely by u/czar_el below, who wrote \"It\\'s the \"tolerance of intolerance\" dilemma. OP is asking where the line is on the spectrum of how to respond to that dilemma.\"',\n",

       "  \"I‚Äôm bored and lonely, so I am writing this to escape my legitimate work to do free unpaid internet labor that no one cares about. This list is intended for everyone who is not in EECS, as we will never be able to even dream of the riches they may attain. Bonus points if you are in a major that people ask you to explain the purpose of when you tell them what you are majoring in. So anyway, here are the top 10 free (first) date ideas I can think of as someone who tries to spend less than a crumpled $10 on any given date (except that one time...).\\n\\n1. Botanical gardens: duh\\n2. Go hiking: Berkeley (and the bay area at large) has some great hiking trails accessible via bus, bart or mere hopping over fences. To spice things up, go to golden gate park!\\n3. Go to amoeba or rasputins: show each other your music taste by going through the cds and vinyls. (show off your cultural capital (social science hoes get that reference)).\\n4. Go to Moe‚Äôs: show each other your taste in books. This is a great way to make sure that your date is literate (you never know with these UCB students).\\n5. Establish a sovereign nation within the bounds of Berkeley: this unfortunately stops short of political revolution, but is a great way of quality checking your date‚Äôs political affiliation and making sure they are not a nazi. Further, on the second date you can help other non-EECS students around you find class consciousness\\n6. Go to Mcdonalds: ask for a cup of water and then take a seat. They probably won't kick you out if you don‚Äôt buy anything. This is a great way to benefit from the ambiance of Mcdonalds without having to shell out the money.\\n7. Bampfa: get into the museum for free with your student ID and show off your art knowledge (or lack thereof). For non-artistic students, I would recommend memorizing a list of shades of colors names to use during the date to make it seem like you have both a base knowledge of art and more importantly an extensive vocabulary. For example: make it a game with yourself to use the word cerulean or chartreuse when describing the art (that way you can combat the possible badness of the date with a private game of bingo).\\n8. A pack of cards at a picnic table: this one has versatility. Play go fish, or speed, or an actually good card game like 52 card pick up. Alternatively, you can build a house of cards together and then knock it over. You may realize the symbolism of the latter only when it is too late. such a realization of the fragility of the first few dates with someone may cause you to brainstorm a list of date ideas and aggressively regret your past actions (and texts).\\n9. Go up the Campanile: this is free with your berkeley id! Once you are at the top floor, you and your date can take turns pointing out the best spots on campus to cry over what could have been with a person (who is not your current date) that you never really did know. sometimes you need to get the recommendations of where to listen/self insert into to I wish you would by taylor swift\\n10. Berkeley Marina at sunset (or sunrise if you are wild like that): how romantic! but don't stay with your date after dark, you may get kidnapped :)\",\n",

       "  'It‚Äôs time we talked openly about the enrollment and budgeting crisis that EECS is facing, which Professor Ayazifar alluded to earlier this week on the EECS 101 Piazza. Put shortly, the entire EECS department is in a precarious state. Faculty and course staff are severely overworked and desperately attempting to maintain current enrollment levels without the necessary funding to do so.\\n\\nOver the last 10 years, the combined enrollment of EECS + L&S CS has ballooned from 380 a decade ago to 1,300 this year, which is about 15% of the graduating undergraduate population!\\n\\nThe available budget has not scaled accordingly. We have no new available full-time faculty. The $-per-student ratio in the budget has stayed constant or dropped, while TA costs have increased by 5‚Äì20%, depending on how many hours a TA works.\\n\\nThe only reason that we haven‚Äôt entirely collapsed yet is because a number of upper-division courses have scaled massively, against budget constraints. This means that we have enough seats per year for these 1,300 students to meet their graduation requirements‚Äîbut this is a very precarious situation. If our overworked faculty fails an upper division course even one semester, we disrupt the traditional pipeline of course staff (student to reader to TA), and our upper division capacity drops below what is needed to be able to sustain the current graduation rate (i.e. students can‚Äôt graduate on time).\\n\\nThere are only two options:\\n\\nOption #1: We scale. We need funding from the University to do this, which we have not received. We also need explicit buy-in from the EECS department to support the level of teaching necessary, i.e. the department formally embraces scalability rather than just having scalability thrust upon it.\\n\\nOption #2: We cut enrollment. This was the new, proposed declare-upon-admission scheme for the L&S CS major, which would have reduced enrollment in a way that allowed students from both traditionally technical and non-traditionally technical backgrounds to have equal opportunity to the major. L&S vetoed this proposal. The only other way to reasonably cut enrollment is to substantially limit L&S CS as a program, severely capping enrollment to the courses needed to declare.\\n\\nHow this affects you:\\n\\nFunding per student from the University is going down  while enrollment is going up, so the enrollment situation is only getting worse.\\n\\nThere is a very real chance that an upper-division course will collapse. You may not be able to take enough courses to graduate on time.\\n\\nThere is a very real chance that we will be forced to significantly limit L&S CS as a major. If you haven‚Äôt declared, you may never get to declare.\\n\\nWe truly would love to teach every student who expresses an interest in EE/CS, but we can‚Äôt do it without University support. The only options that are left to us, without an increase in funding, are desperate.\\n\\nCurrently, we would like to pursue a Town Hall with EECS administrative faculty to get the full picture of the enrollment and funding crisis. There is still so much we don‚Äôt understand, and we want to gain a clearer picture of what has been happening behind the scenes. Vocal support will help us to get this scheduled.\\n\\nFor now, filling out our form (linked in the comments) will help us show the department and University that students would like to see change on this issue. You can also join us on Discord (link in comments) where we want to continue this conversation and talk about our next steps.\\n\\nBeyond that, the best thing that students can do right now: Make noise. Share this in the circles that you‚Äôre in. The funding crisis is not a new conversation, only one that we would like to begin directly informing students about and including students in. The general student body will need to be involved for change to start happening.\\n\\n- EECS ASEs',\n",

       "  'Once again it is time for my personal observations & thoughts on the state of COVID and the University.\\n\\nSo far the data on Omicron appears near best-case in terms of impact given its hyper-virulent nature.  Its unclear how severe it is for those not vaccinated but for those who are vaccinated and boosted Omicron does appear to be \"just a cold\", albeit one that would still be very serious for those in high risk communities such as immuno-compromised individuals.\\n\\nAs such although the surge in infections is breathtaking (even more than Delta was, and totally trashing Covid Classic in infectiousness), hospitalizations are only starting to tick up and even that may be due to remaining Delta infections.  We saw this in South Africa, the UK, and we seem to be following the trajectory here.  This is about the best case scenario we can have.\\n\\nThis of course leaves the University going into the spring semester in a really tough position.  If they decide to start with in-person instruction on the 18th they will get a lot of flak for \"ignoring COVID\".  If they go remote-only at the start, they will get a lot of flack for \"overreacting\".   But I bet the University will announce shortly the first two weeks are remote, and in the end I think its the right decision but not for the one you might think.\\n\\nThe reason why this is the right decision is accessibility.  A huge fraction of the student body returning from break is going to get Covid.  A huge fraction of the faculty and staff will.  I\\'m cautious bordering on paranoid and I think I\\'ll probably get it.  But I\\'m not actually worried about it.  But getting it is disruptive.\\n\\nA vaccinated individual who\\'s infected but either asymptomatic or mild symptoms is supposed to isolate for 5 days after a positive test under the new CDC guidance, and IMO that guidance is broken.  [1].  But given such guidance or even more conservative university guidance, a COVID+ is a loss of a week+ of schooling or work if things are in person.  But if remote it is no loss at all, its the same sucky shit for all of us.\\n\\xa0\\nSo my bet is the following:\\n\\nOmicron from a public health standpoint ends up a fairly minor event compared to Delta and Covid Classic.  This is even moreso for the University population that has a vaccine mandate.\\n\\nOmicron from a disruption standpoint however is more significant, because a huge fraction are going to end up infected.  Combined with a university administration that is generally cautious about anything not involving the football team\\'s TV revenues and stadium sponsorships, I think it is highly likely the first couple weeks will be online only.\\n\\n\\n[1] It should be you should isolate until two days of negative on ANTIGEN testing, not PCR, since PCR is too sensitive but the antigen (take-home) tests are basically matching infectiousness with their sensitivity level.  Of course, this would have also required the US to actually approve the diverse # of vendors that make such tests instead of basically creating a de-facto duopoly up until very very recently.',\n",

       "  'I lost some faith in the moral fabric of berkeley students last night.\\n\\nSome might remember: around midnight yesterday, near the durant food court, an incident occurred which brought several police cars and a crowd of about 100. From what I saw, a mentally ill man in the front seat of a car, stopped in the road by two police cars, was having some kind of psychotic break and was clearly unequipped to drive, especially with a woman and a baby in the backseat. In my opinion, police presence *was* appropriate given the lack of safety in the situation, but whether their actions were justifiable is debatable. For one thing, I heavily blame the escalation of the situation on the horde of Berkeley students gathering, recording, watching, and *laughing* at the situation. At first, I thought recording was okay in order to keep the police involved accountable, but I highly doubt that people had that intention, since this man\\'s suffering was apparently amusing to them. I feel guilty for not speaking up and telling people to have some respect, but I\\'m not sure I would\\'ve had much of an effect since the crowd was pretty strong, or maybe I\\'m just a pussy. The police restrained the man, supposedly because he was not complying, as instead of following their orders, he presented clearly an incapacity to function normally, rocking back and forth in his chair and only repeating \"I\\'m scared, I\\'m scared, I\\'m scared, I\\'m scared, I\\'m scared...\". He said nothing else. I\\'m sure that if the crowd elevating the situation had acted appropriately, the police would have felt less pressured to resort to force, as they likely would have waited for the man to calm down, and dealt with the situation in a way that was less traumatic for the man. Instead, people laughed and recorded as he was pulled out of the car by five officers, forced onto the ground to be handcuffed, and restrained with a lot of pressure on the ground for a good ten minutes. Not to virtue signal but the situation honestly made me tear up, and I will never view privileged Berkeley fucks the same way again. Also, this might have cured my imposter syndrome lol.',\n",

He was putting up posters to raise awareness about human rights abuses experienced by Hong Kongers and Uyghurs. A man wearing a ‚ÄúCal‚Äù hoodie confronted, and threatened him in Mandarin. When the victim took out his phone and tried to record the assault, the assailant pushed him to the floor and attempted to snatch his phone, leaving a wound on his left hand. The perpetrator only released him when a bystander intervened, but then continued to tear down more posters.\\n\\nThis was a clear attempt to silence someone speaking up for human rights through intimidation and physical violence. The perpetrator‚Äôs assault not only violated the law, but also the rights and dignity of the victim, in particular the victim‚Äôs freedom of expression.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. Hongkonger and Chinese students‚Äô freedom of expression are being suppressed at American universities by force in recent years. \\n\\nSince 2019, many more incidents have arisen. Last year, participants were harassed at UC Davis‚Äô ‚ÄúStand With Hong Kong‚Äù rally on October 1st last year. Just a few days ago at UC San Diego, the ‚Äú8964‚Äù Tiananmen Massacre Memorial installation was vandalized and destroyed. More examples can be found on the infographic that Students For Hong Kong has put together. \\n\\nAll of these incidents show a serious pattern of harassment and intimidation towards students who criticize the Chinese government‚Äôs various human rights violations, and the result is a chilling effect on students‚Äô willingness to speak up about human rights, despite ostensibly enjoying a constitutional right to freedom of speech.\\n\\nSupport from those in positions of power is essential to fighting this kind of intimidation. For instance, in 2019 the Associated Students of UC Davis passed a resolution titled ‚ÄúDavis For Hong Kong‚Äù that condemned the intimidation and harassment faced by Hong Kong student groups at UC Davis.  \\n\\nWe should be free of fear when speaking up on university campuses, and especially so in the United States, where freedom of speech is considered a basic civil right and social value, and is also enshrined in the US Constitution.\\n\\nIn solidarity with our fellow peers, we urge our allies, as well as students and administrators at Cornell University, UC San Diego, UC Berkeley, the University of California system, the University of California Student Association, and all student governments to condemn such intimidation, assault, and harassment. Tertiary education institutions that promote equality and diversity should ensure that the rights of students, particularly marginalized students, are protected.\\n\\nIn the unfortunate yet likely case that more and more instances of violence, harassment, and intimidation against Hongkonger students and our allies will continue to happen, we strongly urge everyone to pay close attention, stand up for students who are being oppressed, and speak up against these incidents.\\n\\nIn solidarity,\\n\\nStudents For Hong Kong   \\nHong Kong Affairs Association of Berkeley \\n\\nCornell Society for the Promotion of East Asian Liberty (SPEAL)\\n\\nMcMaster Stands With Hong Kong\\n\\nHong Kong Student Advocacy Group at NYU (NYUHKSAG)\\n\\nWe The Hongkongers',\n",

If you are triple vaccinated, healthy, and young you do not need to be worried outside of being in contact with elderly and other at-risk groups ( who should have their accommodations). I\\'M vaccinated and if you are vaccinated too have done your job. FUCK the people who don\\'t want to get vaccinated at this point. While the cases of Omocrion are up, the rate of hospitalization and deaths is low because this variant is more contagious and less deadly. \\n\\n4. Look, I identify as a liberal, however this mindset within the liberal community is just toxic and nonsensical. If you seriously expect people to lock themselves inside, cut off all social interaction, and pretend covid is the black plague, or vilify people for not taking extreme precautions you are delusional.',\n",

You choose the salad bar and fish because you want to be healthy.  You sit in the corner and eat half the food because it is literally undercooked.

People will say it\\'s expensive, but lots of us are paying a huge amount of money for seriously inedible food.  Imagine having high quality, safe-to-eat, delicious food at the dining halls.  Food waste will be minimized because people will actually be able to eat.  I saw so many people throw out whole plates of food because it\\'s unsafe or just disgusting. Additionally, Cal\\'s reputation as a university can only increase.  Everyone I know raves about UCLA\\'s dining hall and how it\\'s so amazing, with crepe bars, steak nights, pro chefs, etc.  That is an extremely convincing selling point for a lot of prospective students for UCLA, and a convincingly nightmarish thought for prospective Cal students given the horror stories that come out of CalDining.

No worries, I'll try to make some new friends. I didn't get into clubs? There probably was something wrong I said in my apps but boo they suck (ended up getting in and loving it). \\n\\nAnd now, looking back, I can't say I did as many crazy things as I thought I would back in hs, but damn, what an experience.

Many students who applied for work-study positions at libraries got rejected, pointing to a funding issue / cost-cutting.\\n* **Technology fees:** Cal has repeatedly pushed extra fees, most recently in the form of [IREF](https://www.dailycal.org/2022/03/29/iref-proposal-violates-student-fee-policy-guidelines/) (‚ÄòInstructional Resilience and Enhancement Fee‚Äô), which is an **additional $132 semesterly fee** to pay for basic, essential technology resources such as Zoom and Google Workspace ‚Äì items that should be coming out of campus‚Äôs existing budget.\\n* **Student organizations**: There is disproportionate resource allocation, wherein organisations such as [KASA](https://www.dailycal.org/2018/04/27/asuc-needs-stop-funding-student-groups-disproportionately/) get more funds, while others with more need/people often fall short. Despite a student org. budget from student fees, many clubs charge a membership fee and still remain underfunded. This may be more an ASUC than Cal admin issue, but it's a problem nonetheless.\\n* **WiFi:** I don‚Äôt think anything more needs to be said about this ‚Äì everyone is familiar with the incessant WiFi frustrations at the tech powerhouse that is Berkeley.\\n* **Dorm housing and meals**: We pay insanely high prices, only to get CalDining‚Äôs tasteless, repetitive, and often **unsanitary food**, which often gets many sick. The housing options are mostly small, shared rooms in old buildings that are not in the best condition, to say the least. As a freshman, this has been by far my biggest problem at Cal.\\n* **Breaks**: Dining halls close during Thanksgiving and Spring Breaks, leaving us (especially OOS/intls who can‚Äôt go home) no option except expensive restaurant meals. Edit: they charge an extra $10 flex dollars in lieu of swipes for low-quality meals at Croads during breaks ‚Äì as if what we‚Äôre already paying wasn‚Äôt enough.\\n* **Flex Dollars**: Bear market etc. products offered in return are very overpriced (even accounting for each flex being $0.9), and frequently unavailable. Most locations where you can use flex dollars are also shut. There‚Äôs no way out ‚Äì flex are mandatorily included in meal plans.\\n* **Tang Medical:** The Tang Center also charges high prices, even after SHIP. Their advice nurse and appointment helplines always have long waiting, and are pretty much useless. They barely made any effort to care for students in quarantine during COVID, and they defer any actual problem or emergency to other hospitals. Also, they monopolistically only accept SHIP for insurance, which on its own is extremely expensive.\\n* **GBO**: Where else will you find a university charging you to attend your own freshman orientation ‚Äì that too upwards of $475 for a hybrid GBO (almost the same even for all-online)?! With this, an additional $380 for three days of housing during GBO. This amounts to **$855 per head**, amassing the university almost **$6 million** for approx. 7000 freshman. Despite this, the orientation is mediocre at best, and **GBO leaders aren‚Äôt even paid.**\\n* **Merch and Tickets**: Unlike most universities, we get little to no university merchandise (GBO or otherwise), and the Cal Student Store takes advantage of this by charging a bomb. We also don‚Äôt get free tickets to any games or performances. Meanwhile, other universities give out not only merch, but also additional goodies.\\n\\nIn the already expensive Bay Area surrounded by college-town rip-offs, and especially given COVID, financial stresses, and inflation, the university should be more considerate about students‚Äô circumstances. But Berkeley clearly cuts corners and milks students at every turn, yet is always short of funds and begging for more money ‚Äì from cold calling alumni at Cal Calling Center, to Big Give (where they raised [$20.7 million](https://biggive.berkeley.edu) this year) ‚Äì all while California is in a [$45.7 billion](https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2022/01/10/governor-projects-46-billion-surplus-despite-record-california-budget/) budget surplus.\\n\\nGiven everything, one can‚Äôt help but wonder ‚Äì where is all our money going? I‚Äôm just a freshman, but I‚Äôve begun assuming that much of what the university does is not for students, but for its own self interest.\\n\\nNow, don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äì this is not to slander Berkeley or scare any prospective students away. Every university has its problems, especially a large public one like Berkeley. And Cal itself is considered top-notch, consistently [ranking](https://www.forbes.com/sites/madisonfernandez/2021/09/08/why-berkeley-is-number-one/) amongst the best universities in the world.\\n\\nBut there are clearly gaps to be filled, and I‚Äôm surprised we‚Äôre not doing more about this, given that we have one of the largest and historically most ‚Äúactive‚Äù student voices in the world. It‚Äôs easy to assume lack of agency, or for your voice to get lost as an individual amongst so many students. But we must come together to go beyond the ‚ÄúBear Minimum‚Äù and **work to make Berkeley better**, pushing for transparency and holding the right people accountable.\",\n",

There‚Äôs great people and places in the area. The professors, in any field, here are world-class. Majority have an open door policy ‚Äî speaking and getting to know such accomplished people is inspiring, and extremely helpful in your career as well.\\n\\nFor example, some math professors would regularly invite/have students to luncheons. Professor Ribet (highly-respected professor in mathematics) is notorious for this.\\n\\nFor example, if you‚Äôre thinking about Physics, there‚Äôs a freaking national lab in Berkeley‚Äôs backyard! (I‚Äôm pretty sure undergrads get positions there; while hard it‚Äôs not impossible to get in)\\n\\nChemistry department is freaking WORLD CLASS.\\n\\nEven for the social sciences and the arts, the people I know in majoring in those areas speak highly of their field here at Berkeley.\\n\\nChoose a random major at Berkeley is it highly likely, almost a guarantee, it is top 5 in the WORLD.\\nYes, it is driven by the professors & grad studies, but undergrads do get research opportunities in their labs and are still able to talk with them. Just being in the room with the people is a boon to anyone. Who do you think gives the recommendations for grad school, med school, law school? Even for industry, professors here are highly connected. For example, Janet Yellen, current US Sec of Treasury, her ex-colleagues? Berkeley professors.\\n\\nI‚Äôm not familiar with every field; thus, I would appreciate if people in all majors chime in and tell prospective applicants about their major here.\\n\\nThis sub get flooded with CS issues that it feels like Berkeley is all CS and trash otherwise.

       "  'I\\'ve been seeing a lot of posts discussing relationship troubles in this subreddit, and it\\'s very sweet how supportive others are here; I figured I\\'d recall something very upsetting that happened yesterday, possibly in hopes of hearing some consolation. Here goes!\\n\\n**TL;DR I made a gift for a boy. He threw it away. I\\'m sad and pissed. What do I do?**\\n\\nLast semester, I met a really, *really* cute guy through a friend\\'s sorority. Although he was a frat boy (I do not associate with Greek life, I\\'m far too introverted lol), his personality was exactly my type: kind, outspoken, well-read, insightful during class, the works. We hung out several times in a group setting, and while the sheer amount of people with us limited our interaction, I found out that we\\'re both huge fans of LEGOs and the Green Lantern comics - the moment he shared his interest in those semi-niche interests, I was done. Head over heels. I\\'ve never had feelings for someone before, until now. The blushing, the butterflies in my stomach, it all felt so good.\\n\\nAfter finding out that his birthday was on the 13th, my friend and I devised a master plan:\\n\\n1. My friend finds out if he\\'s single by asking other frat boys. Conveniently, he is.\\n2. I make a handmade card for his birthday. It was nothing too fancy, just a drawing of Oski with a party hat and a birthday cake that read something like: \"Happy birthday \\\\[Name!\\\\] Hope this year treats you well!\" I spent a good while sketching and coloring Oski, cutting out pieces to make a pop-up effect, and accenting everything with markers and deco paper. The pi√®ce de r√©sistance was this LEGO Green Lantern keychain minifig that I scoured Earth and Heaven for, which I looped into the card by punching a hole in its corner.\\n3. After Legal Studies, I gave the card to him and confessed: \"I really like you, \\\\[Name.\\\\]  I think you\\'re cute and incredibly talented, and I\\'d love to get to know you more. You have my number, let me know.\" With that, I left for the girls\\' Haas bathroom. I was far too anxious to wait for a response.\\n\\nHere\\'s where I f\\\\*cked it all up. Just as I left, Crush\\'s frat friends were approaching him. I could hear every word from the bathroom (it\\'s the one in the Student Services building, so you can imagine if you\\'ve been there lol.) They were mostly laughing and saying \"dude, look at this!\" Maybe my retrospective knowledge distorted what was happening, but it seemed like they were passing around the card and mocking it...which was confirmed when I left to throw away my gum wrapper in the landfill bin.\\n\\nAnd there, I found the card, LEGO dude and all. In the trash. The *trash*.\\n\\nObviously, I swallowed my dignity and fished out Green Lantern because I looked EVERYWHERE for the little f\\\\*cker, but I didn\\'t bother with the card. Regardless, it left me pretty heartbroken. I cried hard last night, and I\\'m having trouble focusing on classes today. I keep wondering if it was my fault for being so forward and just putting it out there without much forethought. Was this a bad move? Did I mess up by thinking a frat boy would like me to begin with? I just want to look for some advice to cope with how I\\'m feeling right now, or how I should go forward with these sorts of things.\\n\\nThis is very hyperspecific so if my former crush reads this, he\\'ll know who it is. So if that\\'s you, I\\'m sorry for venting (and eavesdropping lol.) But you suck. And not because of the rejection, either. There\\'s no obligation for you - or anyone - to reciprocate my feelings. You suck because no decent person throws away a LEGO minifigure.\\n\\n**Also, if anyone wants the keychain, which I guess might be a collector\\'s item because they don\\'t make them anymore, let me know.**\\n\\n***EDIT: I feel so, so much better now, thank you so much for the affirmations! Your kindness has been so heartwarming and because of that, I mustered the courage to go to all of my classes and finish all my readings today, yay!! I will be hiding this post in a bit but I just wanted everyone to see that they made my day and I am so grateful to have such a lovely community to lean on. No more tears I promise :))***',\n",

Go as soon as possible tonight. It wont be there tomorrow, and if it is it will go bad!\\n\\nTIPS:\\nBring a flashlight (preferably a hands-free head light). And dirty clothes. Rubber/surgery gloves are good too. There will be more than you can take (even if 30 people show up), so bring your biggest strongest shopping bags and keep in mind the walk back to your house. If you have a bike it will be easier as you can just hang the bags on the sides and walk easily. If you have a car then youre lucky.

ALSO PLEASE DONT MAKE A MESS THAT OTHERS WILL HAVE TO CLEAN UP TOMORROW MORNING. Just the basic dumpster diving manners. If you dont follow these, the store will start locking the container so no one can get it. Dont ruin it for others in need.\\n\\nPROS:\\nThere are TONS of cheeses. If you have a freezer, then youre in luck because there is even more ice cream. Ice cream is almost melted but most tubs are sealed (so just needs to be frozen and youre good). There is so much ice cream that its overwhelming. There is plenty of other stuff like  spreads, hummus, fruit juices, pesto sauces, etc, etc. There are all kinds of delicacy cheeses and spreads from Europe. Very fancy stuff. Total shame its getting chucked out.\\n\\nCONS: \\nA few ice cream spills here and there, but nothing gross. Remember, everything in there just got thrown out today. Nothing is rotten or expired.\\nAnother con is there is literally sooo much stuff its overwhelming and sorting / going through it takes time (if youre picky). \\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nMy friends and I scouted the area and waited for everyone (workers) to leave the store.

The night before, and early that morning, I\\'d been experiencing a lot of Mobbing behavior, including via residents at Unit 3, and by that morning I felt backed far enough into a corner where I felt the necessary course of action to \"defend\" myself from continuation of that sort of bullying was to switch into a mode of hyperaggressive negativity and confrontationalism towards whomever I crossed paths with in the view of the public, as some sort of prophylactic measure to establish myself as scary and destructive enough to ward off any potential targeting, and justified this mindset by equating anyone I needed to as \\'probably one of -them-\\'. \\n\\nClearly, you where no \"them\". You are an inspiration and a man beyond words, and I obviously couldn\\'t have taken my personal shit out on a less deserving individual. You single handedly brought an end to my budding terror-attack of a morning, you rescued my mental and emotional state that day from a very dark and despondent depth, and you literally saved the local citizenry from a hellacious and destructive onslaught of venomous, randomly targetted behavior (e.g, a temper tantrum by a 250 pound baby).\\n\\n I feel ashamed beyond words for damaging the car  of such a reputable and kind natured man. Thank you again for choosing the path of forgiveness, empathy, and open minded consideration, where I myself would have came with a 2 by 4 long before I\\'d have came bearing fresh pastries. \\n\\nAnd, as it so happens to be, I was --fucking starving--.',\n",
       "  'Annoyed by the amount of misinformation I am seeing about the Omicron variant and the status of the pandemic online, I thought I would post some information, accompanied by citations, about this variant and what we know about it so far. I have particularly tried to emphasize numbers regrading the risks posed by Omicron.\\n\\nBackground on Omicron:\\n\\n* The Omicron variant of (VOC-21NOV-01 (B.1.1.529)) is the dominant strain of COVID (SARS-CoV-2) currently in circulation in California (95% of COVID cases) and the US (95.4% of Covid cases) \\\\[1\\\\].\\n* Omicron has been shown to be significantly less infectious in many lab models (including rodents and organoids), it is found at a reduced level in lung tissue, and the variant does not bind as well as previous strains to a key protein (TMPRSS2) on the surface of lung cells \\\\[4\\\\]. (Quote from virologist in this article: ‚Äúthe virus establishes a very local infection in the upper airways and has less chance to go and wreak havoc in the lungs.‚Äù)\\n* (Added, 1/9/21, 3:41 PM) Somewhat in contrast to previous variants of Coronavirus, the top five symptoms for omicron infection appear to be: runny nose, headache, fatigue (either mild or severe), sneezing, and sore throat. \\\\[6, para. 2\\\\]\\n\\nRisk of hospitalization from Omicron:\\n\\n* The risk of hospitalization (to either emergency care or usual hospital admission) for the general public (i.e., regardless of vaccination status or underlying co-morbidities) for Omicron is approximately half of that for Delta \\\\[2, pg. 4, para. 1\\\\]. Moreover, the risk of hospitalization for Omicron is ‚Äî as compared to the unvaccinated public ‚Äî 65% lower after full vaccination and 81% lower after full vaccination + booster \\\\[2, pg. 9, table 4\\\\].\\n* Data from the US (pre-Omicron): the hospitalization rate for the vaccinated population is 0.01% (roughly 1 in 10,914 cases), and the rate for unvaccinated adults is 0.89% (or 89 in 10000 cases) \\\\[3, appendix\\\\].\\n* In the UK, the hospitalization rate (for the general public, for Omicron) is somewhere between 41 and 18 per 10,000 cases \\\\[2, pg. 3, para 3\\\\].\\n* Put together, the previous 3 points suggest that for the vaccinated population the risk of hospitalization is very low ‚Äî less than 1 hospitalization per 10,000 cases.\\n\\nRisk of death from Omicron:\\n\\n* Up to Dec 29, 2021, the UK had somewhere between 198,348 cases (these are confirmed by lab tests) to up to 451,194 ‚Äúprobable‚Äù cases of Omicron (via a less sensitive protocol - SGTF) \\\\[2, pg. 3, para. 3\\\\].\\n* Of these cases, 57 people have died in the UK within 28 days of receiving an Omicron diagnosis; these individuals were aged between 41 and 99 yo at time of death \\\\[2, pg. 6, para. 4\\\\]. This puts the death rate (in the UK) between 0.028% and 0.013%.

       "  'Have you ever looked at an integral and thought \"damn, I would fuck the shit outta that\"? Seriously. You might be thinking, \"what the fuck dude, why would you jack off to a general solution?\" but hold up. Hear me out for a second. Just hear me out, please. Just imagine being a cucked lonely virgin. The moment you enrolled to study Mathematics. No, the moment you decided to actually study it and not be one of those alpha brainlets who whine about how \\'lame\\' it is; that is the moment when you declared something. You declared this very statement to not only yourself (in the very soul), to your parents, to your friends and family, to the hypothetical God. You declared that you are a virgin, and for as long as you do not stray from this path, your virginity will not stray from you. You will be a virgin forever. This fact is being taken with you to your grave, just like Newton\\'s Three Laws. Now, I get it. You\\'re a teenager. Hormones kick in. Girls start to look more and more attractive. But guess who can\\'t talk to them - you! Because you\\'re a Mathematician! Let\\'s be real here, the majority of girls won\\'t be studying Mathematics at the same level as you. Whether it be A Level Further Maths, or at university where the only types of \\'anal\\' you\\'re getting are Real and Complex. You won\\'t even get a chance to talk to them, because they\\'ll always be with the Psychology chads, with the Management chads. Heck there\\'s probably even Engineers getting in on the action. But don\\'t count on the Computer Scientists, the difference between us and them are that they will spend hours trying to computationally solve our problem of loneliness. They will decompose the hell out of it only to end up with what we, as Mathematicians, have deduced from the very beginning; there is no solution. You will be virgin for life as a Mathematician (CS is a field of Mathematics, okay). Now that we have that out of the way, what do we, as Mathematicians, do to pleasure ourselves? We solve equations. Honestly, there comes a point where solving equations will make you orgasm. But why so? Is it the excitement of finding the solution? Perhaps this level of satisfaction is what we desire. It is what we will never get after spending so much effort in chasing women. Which leads to POINT 1: Math is like an orgasm. You won\\'t get this reward when talking to a girl. Come on man. You won\\'t get her. But when you get the solution to that hard problem, that truly is the best thing ever. Now for POINT 2: Math is sexy. We like girls because of their \\'thicc\\' or \\'slim\\' or \\'petite\\' body. But dude, have you ever seen Mathematical notation? Greek letters? Heck, even the integral sign is probably curvier than your crush. But the difference is, integration will always be with you for years to come, likely for the rest of your life. Calculus is truly wife material. An advantage to this being that integrals won\\'t be a bitch if you have the brains. If you don\\'t, then you need to train harder. That leads me to POINT 3: Math is good for the brain. Seriously. Solving some problems is like going to the gym. You are training your brain. Writing is a hand exercise. There comes a point where you do so much Math that it becomes embedded within your very senses. This is why pornography, hentai and whatnot just doesn\\'t do it for me. My mind is so clear because of Mathematics that I can geometrically interpret these sexual videos. They aren\\'t all that. Overhyped to be honest. Girls\\' breasts aren\\'t perfect hemispheres. I don\\'t see the appeal in this stuff anyway. Why would you want to look at these jagged lines and irregular shapes when you can see the fully raw, high quality, real deal that is a Mathematical expression? Nature runs on Mathematics, it\\'s proven. So to be a man of nature, you must be a man of Mathematics. Hence, masturbating to Mathematics is environmentally friendly.

I tried to plunge the drain myself and a bunch of dirt from the pipes came up and filled the sink. I informed my landlord about the problem, and was shocked to learn that he does not intend to fix it at all. In fact, he insists this is my fault and is trying to charge me to fix this. After I pushed a little further, he said that previous plumbing issues (from when I first moved in) must have been my fault and is now trying to charge me for those too.

Just because it didn\\'t happen in the first week doesn\\'t mean it\\'s over.  \\n\\nPlease don\\'t box yourself in by saying to yourself \"I suck at making friends\".   The mind is pliable and the world is your oyster.  Telling yourself that you suck and there\\'s no hope is strictly unproductive and makes you feel worse. \\n\\nHere\\'s my advice from someone who made 0 friends until my last year of college:  \\n\\n1. develop a mindset that allows for personal growth.  Believe in yourself and your process.  Don\\'t get pressed over trivial crap.  For example, I had a super awkward interaction at a club and I was thinking about it for days, just bashing myself for being weird.  looking back, it straight up doesn\\'t matter.  Don\\'t let things affect you if they don\\'t have to.  This takes time to learn but is a paramount skill for contentment in life.\\n2. Absolutely join clubs.  I recommend the chiller ones, so people who jerk off over internships aren\\'t there.  Avoid most business clubs.  There are tons of groups out there with awesome people so always keep looking.\\n3. Prioritize your mental health.  If shit is stressing you out, go talk to someone like a therapist.  Learn to meditate.  This is important.\\n4. Sometimes despite trying your hardest, you just might not click with some people.  That\\'s okay.  Don\\'t be discouraged and find people that you vibe with.  \\n5. For basic friend making skills, try to be open and confident.  Be responsive, look people in the eyes, smile, laugh, use expression in your face and voice.  As an introvert I often come across as totally disinterested or standoffish.  I had to keep that in mind and actively put in effort to change that.\\n\\nTLDR:  you\\'re gonna be okay. You have plenty of time.  be confident in yourself and don\\'t be afraid if things aren\\'t going well just yet.  Have a belief that things will work out rather than say they never will.  Join clubs and try improving on things like cadence, expressions, and being more energetic if you\\'re still struggling. \\n\\nCollege is a big transition.  And Berkeley is a big place.

       "  'Hi everyone. With the end of the semester upon us, many of us are obviously dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety right now. We all want to do well on finals, and many of us will go to great lengths to do so - but sometimes, we go too far.  \\n\\n\\nAs a pharmacology student with a *lot* of experience with substance abuse, addiction, and mental health issues, some of the things I see my peers doing for the sake of their GPAs honestly scares the living shit out of me. I see my friends and classmates going through Adderall like Tic-Tacs, staying up for 3+ days straight, getting black out drunk at night just to unwind, and worse. It especially scares me that many really have no idea just how dangerous some of these behaviors are. So, I\\'ve compiled a small list of friendly reminders to help stay physically and mentally healthy throughout finals:  \\n\\n\\n1. **More stimulants does NOT equal better performance:** It\\'s an easy trap to fall into; we associate stimulant drugs with energy and productivity - so, when we feel like we aren\\'t getting as much done as we would like, many of us have the impulse to simply take more. *That is not how it works*. Most common stimulants (e.g. caffeine, cocaine, Adderall, methamphetamine, Ritalin, etc.) primarily function as dopamine receptor agonists; they release more dopamine into the pre-frontal cortex, which increases energy levels, focus, motivation, etc. There is a \"sweet spot\" for dopamine levels, however, and surpassing it by consuming more dopaminergenic stimulants generally only serves to intensify negative side effects without adding benefits. Often, ***less is more!*** It\\'s different for everyone, but try limiting yourself to 2 cups of coffee in the morning, or try sticking to 10mg of Adderall per day instead of 20, 30, or whatever the number may be; your GPA and your body will thank you.\\n2. **Things can get very dangerous** ***very*** **quickly:** This applies to substance consumption, coping with stress (e.g. engaging in frequent hookups to have fun during free time), and lifestyle decisions in general. It doesn\\'t take much to cause a great deal of physical harm, and if you\\'re not careful, things can escalate VERY quickly. For example, a short Adderall binge might not feel like enough to cause any damage in the moment - but if you take just a little too much, you can easily risk a heart attack, severe dehydration, compulsive redosing, and even permanent damage to vital organs. You might feel like you can skip a few nights of sleep to continue studying - but if you stay up a little too long, you can quickly find yourself in the depths of psychosis without even realizing it. ***Make sure you are consistently doing all of the things a human is supposed to do to stay healthy.*** Sleep *every* night; it doesn\\'t matter if you have an essay due tomorrow that you haven\\'t started - go to sleep and handle it in the morning. Consistently drink water. Know your limits when it comes to substances. Eat at least two meals per day, preferably three. Get at least a little exercise and time outside. **Your brain cannot function at full capacity if you don\\'t take care of yourself;** if not for your own sake, stay healthy for the sake of your grades.\\n3. **It\\'s easier to drive yourself crazy than you might expect:** This is especially important to remember if you are consuming psychoactive substances of any kind, but is also very important even if you are 100% straight edge. The mind is an incredibly powerful force, and it can be easy to forget that the mind must *constantly be kept stable*. In extremely high-stress environments (\\\\*cough\\\\* like finals week at Cal \\\\*cough\\\\*), we tend to relegate mental stability to the back-burners, justifying such behavior as a natural inevitability stemming from a sense of duty toward our responsibilities. **Don\\'t make this mistake!** Letting stress of any kind run rampant and uncontrolled throughout your psyche can lead to some extremely unpleasant and dangerous consequences. If not careful, you could find yourself in the middle of a hypermanic, depressive, psychotic, or otherwise neurotic episode, and it is NOT fun. If drugs are involved, these risks are greatly amplified; I\\'ve had entire weeks erased from my memory, bouts of very regretful hyper-impulsiveness, and some horrendously traumatic mental breakdowns from combining substances with unaddressed mental health problems. *Take breaks, maintain a good routine, get enough sleep, and do things you enjoy*; again, it\\'ll help your grades!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis list is pretty broad and by no means comprehensive, but I think these are some basic essential things to keep in mind over the course of the next week (and all the time tbh). It all sounds straight forward enough, but I know that actually staying on top of this stuff can be WAY easier said than done - it certainly is for me. Thanks for reading, and I hope this can be helpful to someone in some way. Stay safe and have fun y\\'all! We\\'re almost done :)\\n\\nAlso, I\\'d like to note that the motivation to make this post specifically came from observing a couple of friends heavily abusing Adderall and other stuff over the last few days; as such, I was intending to discuss in greater depth some rules regarding safe substance use/harm reduction, as this is a field that I am very interested in and that I think more people should know more about. As I typed this out, though, I decided this could be generalized outside of substance consumption - BUT, if you are currently/planning on using any psychoactive drugs, I would be happy to share more specific pharmacological information that can help you use safely! Reach out with any questions/curiosities whatsoever, and I\\'ll do my best to assist üòä\\n\\nTL;DR/Moral of the story: Check in with yourself, don\\'t deviate from the ground rules of life (like sleeping every night), keep your mental health in check, and exercise responsible substance consumption practices; good luck to everyone! üíû',\n",

       "  'Brace yourselves for yet another rant about CalDining.\\n\\nPerhaps it has been over a month since I last had CalDining, and as my friends would say, \"We lost all of our dining hall tolerance over the break.\"  Maybe it\\'s just COVID, but I am outright disgusted with the school for some of the food that they have served.  How can they really be okay with it?  I get that they\\'re trying to save money on the cost of food, but it\\'s still absolutely disgusting that they think serving moldy salads with mealworms is okay.\\n\\nI honestly can not count the amount of times I have gone to the dining hall only to be disappointed with the quality of food that they serve.  Some of it is not fresh at all and has been sitting out for hours and hours at a time.  Food spoils and goes bad, and I\\'d really rather not grab a helping of watery, lukewarm yogurt during breakfast that has been sitting out for probably 4+ hours.  Or some of the meat (specifically, chicken) is very undercooked at Cafe 3.  There have also been a few instances where the burgers are moldy or I found bugs in my salads.  I get that college isn\\'t surrounded around the cafeteria food, but this is just inedible and not okay.  There are also other instances where I strongly feel as if the cafeteria dining hall food has violated many health codes.\\n\\nAs someone with very strict dietary restrictions, I can not count the many times that CalDining has made me sick.  I‚Äîalong with some friends of mine‚Äîhave some pretty severe allergies.  For instance, those who have Celiac are majorly affected by this.  Even when choosing the \"allergen-friendly\" options, I noticed that there is a lot of food cross-contamination from using either the same serving spoon as another dish that has one grain of flour can simply trigger a chronic illness.  With me, I have many allergies, but the most severe one is a seafood allergy, and the slightest bit of shrimp, scallops, or shellfish cross-contamination will trigger any allergic reaction and make my nose runny, throat itchy, and tongue start to feel swollen.\\n\\nAdditionally, It is rather disappointing that they have not updated their menus.  I understand that we have been spoiled with new-aged technology to show us the menus right at our fingertips, but it would be nice to know what the dining halls are serving BEFORE I waste a meal swipe at the dining hall for food that has everything I can\\'t eat due to allergies.  I went to a dining hall today for take-out-style, and I wasted a meal swipe just to find out that the only options are almost everything I am allergic to.  Of course, I could eat the one thing out of the meal, but that is not very ideal for me when I am paying a lot of money for a meal plan and food I can not eat and will have to waste.\\n\\nI also found out that some CalDining workers DO NOT have a food handler\\'s certificate.  This is illegal on many levels.  It is a law in California that anyone who handles food MUST have their food handler\\'s permit, certificate, etc.  \\n\\nAccording to CA Senate Bill No. 303...\\n\\n>all food handlers are required to obtain a California food handler card after completing a food safety training course and passing an assessment\\n\\nKnowing that someone who is preparing the food and possibly does not have a food handler\\'s card makes me very uneasy knowing that the lack of training can make me or many others sick, especially when dining hall employees are dropping the food and putting it back on my boyfriend\\'s plate in front of him.  Additionally, it\\'s just disgusting because they will sometimes pick up a pancake with their gloved-hands instead of tongs.  Gloves are significantly better than bare-hands, I will have to admit.\\n\\nOverall, CalDining, do better.

I do not want to sound like a creep but how do I convince him to teach 61B one more time so my friend from high school can take 61B from him next year.

UCLA, UCSD, Davis, and UCSB have all confirmed in-person for next week, and Stanford is already in-person.  UC Merced is the only UC that I know of that has announced staying remote next week and their situation is significantly different than the situation in the bay area [1].\\n\\nIn my opinion this is the right decision.  In a highly vaccinated and ideally boosted population (like Berkeley), where the health care system is not overwhelmed, Omicron really is just a nasty cold.  But still a highly contagious one so we still need to plan on plenty of absences over the next couple of weeks.\\n\\nAdditionally, data out of Israel suggests that \"long covid\" doesn\\'t affect the vaccinated.  The symptoms of long covid can be caused by many things, not just Covid-19, and the rate of long-covid symptoms in vaccinated and then infected is the same rate as those never infected in the first place!\\n\\nAnd finally the University is not actually letting its guard down, and if anything is improving the situation.\\n\\nYou are now required not only to wear masks but to wear good masks: No more cloth allowed.  Instead a procedure mask is a minimum, and they are finally, FINALLY handing out N95s to employees (so I no longer have to, but as I do prefer the fit of the Kimtechs and 3M Auras over the BYD Healthcare N95s, I\\'ll still be giving some away to my staff who prefer the Kimtechs or 3Ms). \\n\\nCombined with HVAC updates I am not concerned about teaching in person, and as everyone knows my COVID paranoia is actually fairly high so if I\\'m comfortable you can probably be too.\\n\\nBut at the same time we know that not everyone is going to be comfortable with \"Mask Up and YOLO!\" like I am.  We will still fully support remote students, although we do have to prioritize in person for some activities (notably lab and office hours) for efficiency reasons as those are far more effective in person and we do only have a limited amount of TA time available.\\n\\nSo for those in person, I\\'ll see you in person.  For those who don\\'t want to, I\\'ll still see people through Zoom.  But know that since I\\'ll be in person for lectures there will be no more Cat Time.

As such the central valley and foothill communities like Merced do not have a highly vaccinated population (since a large amount of the Republican party is now an explicit pro-Covid death cult) and therefore are experiencing a more overwhelmed health-care system.',\n",

It seems scary but I‚Äôm extremely optimistic that all people who are qualified will have a chance to make it into cs. There‚Äôs no way they apply unfair policies retroactively. Also, even if they do create an unfair policy, data science is genuinely an excellent major. Only reason it gets shit at Berkeley is because it tends to be a backup. At any other school in the nation and in industry, DS is a highly respected and sought-after major. Your life and career in CS does not depend on a major anyway.\\n\\n2. Berkeley undergraduate CS education is genuinely excellent. There is a reason we are ranked #1 for undergrad CS. We have insane opportunities, and our classes teach skills and concepts at a depth you don‚Äôt see many other places. 61a, 70, etc teach us to think very analytically, and that‚Äôs extremely important long-term. Look at UCLA cs curriculum, for example. Much of their intro classes revolve around memorizing syntax. The expectations are significantly lower, and I thus think they are getting a relatively worse education (even tho UCLA is still a great program). We may be underfunded right now, but that doesn‚Äôt take away from the fact that we are receiving a high quality education.\\n\\n3. Please stop with the removing eecs 16b as a requirement. For one, it‚Äôs not happening. No EECS faculty supports this, and for good reason. I 100% agree that the concepts learned in 16b are foundational to any engineering education. If you combine cs with robotics, machine learning, computer architecture, etc., 16b concepts will pop up everywhere. (Not to mention that Lin alg is super important too) Yeah, it‚Äôs a hard class, often poorly run, with a fuck ton of work, and should probably be 5 units, but the content is good and necessary.\\n\\n\\nEveryone has a right to be angry and critique issues: that‚Äôs how we promote necessary and important change. But at some point, we waste energy being angry and worrying. There‚Äôs no need to threaten lawsuits or do other impulsive things. EECS faculty tend to be on our side and advocating for us; have a little faith things will work out. And if they don‚Äôt, let‚Äôs have a measured and coherent (and not impulsive and angry) response. Everyone‚Äôs on the same side here; don‚Äôt vilify the people trying to help you.',\n",

It\\'s understandable that one might think that, given the similarities of the current situation to what happened in March 2020. I might even get downvoted for providing the opposing perspective here. But let\\'s look at the facts. \\n\\n**Berkeley is already mostly open even with higher caseloads than ever before:**\\n\\nThe most cases we had in a week before now was around 150. Last week we had 630 cases on campus. Yet Berkeley hasn\\'t closed libraries, dorms, the RSF, etc. If they really felt the situation was surprisingly bad, then they would close more of those things, but they haven\\'t done that. \\n\\n**The Omicron wave has likely peaked and is now on its way down:**\\n\\nCalifornia case data [is clear](https://imgur.com/ntkXYBY): it looks like the peak of cases is behind us. In most other places which had an Omicron surge, cases went down just as fast as they went up (The UK, [for example](https://imgur.com/kIf2BKW)), so we should expect cases to start falling fairly quickly. We certainly shouldn\\'t expect Omicron to continue having much of an impact past the next couple of weeks. \\n\\n**Administration continues to plan to open on the 31st:**\\n\\nBerkeley\\'s admin is generally pretty vague about things, but they haven\\'t said anything like \"we may or may not be open on the 31st\" or \"if cases are below X, we\\'ll reopen\". It really does seem like their current plan is to reopen on the 31st. This leads me to believe that the only reason they wouldn\\'t go back to in-person instruction is if something unexpected happened, and still having a relatively high caseload would not be unexpected (they even say that they expect \"pandemic conditions\" to continue into February). \\n\\n\\nThere also isn\\'t much transmission in classrooms, Omicron is milder especially for boosted people, etc. Overall, I\\'d say there\\'s a very high chance that we do in fact reopen in-person classes as planned on the 31st.

I was still on food-stamps, working 3 jobs, but when I got to Berkeley I took out some loans so I could focus on studying and spend time working in a lab. Not too many loans, I qualified for free tuition and grants, but enough. Invested some of it in Tesla back when it was $30, but had to sell when it reached $400 to pay off my loans and because I was out of money. I would have a couple hundred grand now‚Ä¶.if I hadn‚Äôt been so poor. Did you do any nifty things?\\n\\nNot to bore you with all the details, but when I graduated I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do. I took a minimum wage job at NASA in a research lab studying exo-biology. Flew to Germany to study termites, and then down to Antarctica for a research expedition. Lived in a van in New Zealand, and then took a job at a biotech back in California. I left that job when my grandma died, my foster mom, and flew up to Alaska and then hitchhiked my way back down. Took a new job doing research with E.coli and applied to grad school at 29.

       "  'Feeling a little frustrated and disappointed atm so decided to share my experiences with other students because I could not find any meaningful information about the Global Internships program myself before I unfortunately signed up and would like to warn others about potentially doing the same.\\n\\nA few months ago, I attended some information sessions about the program and was very interested in going to London this summer. I specifically chose this program because I wanted to gain work experience abroad and love the city. This program guarantees an internship placement in your field of choice and has a lengthy information form and interview process you have to complete to assess your desired placement areas. Additionally, students also get housing for the summer and are enrolled in two required summer courses (one online, one in person). Berkeley‚Äôs program provider partner for the London Global Internships is this company called Anglo Educational Services (AES). This program seemed very legit and was marketed very well, with slideshows and the main facilitators of the program answering student questions and the Berkeley program adviser (Breanne) there as well. Needless to say, it was hyped up as a great experience that could be used as a building block in forming professional contacts overseas and I, along with many other students, was excited to participate this summer. \\n\\nThis was back in late February/early March. To put it mildly, this whole process has been a complete shit show and not at all what I signed up for:\\n\\n‚Ä¢Visas: the people at AES took several weeks to issue the basic student numbers needed to begin the application process for student visas for the summer. Because of this, we have all been scrambling around to set up appointment dates for the visa process in time for the start of the program this summer. These numbers were issued so late that the program is supposed to start in a few days and not everyone has their passport back with their visa in it yet.\\n\\n‚Ä¢Housing: AES doesn‚Äôt disclose anything about your living situation until you actually arrive on site. They give a building address and that‚Äôs about it. They won‚Äôt let you know in advance how many people you will share a room/suite with or who they are. They randomly assign roommates and don‚Äôt take into account living preferences while doing so, so it‚Äôs on you to find other students in the program that have similar habits etc. And even roommate requests are not guaranteed and are subject to change.\\n\\n‚Ä¢Classes: at the outset of this program, we were told that our in person class (which meets twice a week) will be scheduled on Friday mornings and Monday afternoons, so that we could take full advantage of our location in London to travel during the weekends (such as other places in the UK or Europe). We are strictly not allowed to miss a single class or internship work day during this program, so this free time over the weekend is crucial to any other tourism we might want to do over summer. We could therefore travel Friday afternoon after class and travel back on Monday morning before class, giving us two full days on Saturday and Sunday to sightsee. Anyways, AES recently came out with the class schedule and they booked classes for early Monday morning, which means we only have a full day on Saturday to be anywhere else and will have to travel back on Sunday afternoon/evening. This is really disappointing to a lot of us since you can‚Äôt really do a proper weekend trip with only one full day to be someplace. When another student emailed AES about this, they said something along the lines of ‚Äúsometimes life doesn‚Äôt work out the way you want it to.‚Äù Like what does that mean??\\n\\n‚Ä¢Internship: Similar to the visa numbers, AES is taking forever to provide internship placements. The internship roles are due to start exactly one week from today, and there are multiple students that still haven‚Äôt had a single interview for a intern position. I received my first one just yesterday. This is totally not what they told us at the beginning, that we would know at the end of May at the LATEST what placement offer we would receive. They also said that we had the option to request an alternative placement up to two additional times (three total different offers) if we weren‚Äôt satisfied with the initial placement option. When I emailed them expressing that I respectfully didn‚Äôt feel that the nonprofit they put me in actually reflected what I said I wanted to do in my application, they said that ‚Äúwhile we say we can give other opportunities, these are only if you reject the internship offer for legitimate reasons‚Äù and that they ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt be able to find [me] another opportunity at this late notice.‚Äù Wtf? Are my completely different interests not a valid reason to request an alternative? The only reason it is ‚Äúlate notice‚Äù is because they took so long to issue a placement offer in the first place, that‚Äôs on them. Like come on, the internship is the main sell of the program and you can‚Äôt even provide students with something that they‚Äôd like to do? Imo they should NOT go around telling students that they can request alternative placements if that‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre willing to do.\\n\\n‚Ä¢Advising: another main sell of the program is that you would have access to advising and counseling from the program providers throughout the whole process. As noted above, they have been incredibly unhelpful this entire time, even responding to emails and questions a bit snarkily and dismissively. Everyone seems to be on their own with this. They flat out don‚Äôt disclose important details ahead of time.\\n\\nBear in mind that this costs over a semester‚Äôs worth of tuition and Berkeley Study Abroad refuses to refund anything after March 28th. This is extremely unfair given that this whole study abroad process had barely even begun by then. Had I known what I know now about this program, there is no way I would have signed up. If we are experiencing this many problems before the program has even started, I can‚Äôt imagine what the rest of this summer will look like. I have talked to other students in the program and we are all extremely disappointed at how this is shaping up to be. For the amount of money drained into this program, I honestly think that it would have been better to just sign up for two online classes that are at least related to my major and found myself volunteer work through cold emailing. All I can do for now is just go along with it so I don‚Äôt lose the thousands of dollars that they will not refund. What can I say, it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating and I feel completely lied to, given that they said one thing during applications and another during this whole process. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did by trusting these people.',\n",

Please note that this is my personal advice, and ugsi experiences vary.\\n\\nHope this is helpful:\\n\\n**Course staff positions available:**\\n\\n**Lab assistant:** Help out in lab sections, typically unpaid, \\\\~3 hrs/week.\\n\\n**Tutor:** Lead small group tutoring sessions and/or do grading & host office hours. Paid hourly.\\n\\n**uGSIs**: Lead a section/lab/workshop, host office hours and grade. Sometimes have piazza responsibilities. Montly salary. Typically 8-hour positions, some 20-hour.\\n\\n**Lead uGSI:** uGSI responsibilities + manage logistics. This includes managing course staff, handling scheduling, test logistics, and helping the professor with whatever is needed. Typically 20-hour positions.\\n\\n**Readers:** Only grade. Sometimes host office hours. Paid hourly.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Departments that hire uGSIs:** Computer Science and Data Science hire the most- mostly all 8-hour positions, some 20-hour, on ugsi-only course staffs. Both have structured & large course staff ladders (see below for typical tracks). Economics hires as well (only 20-hour roles alongside PhD students- need to be an SLC tutor or a previous ugsi in another department to qualify). Astronomy and math also hire occasionally- less clear processes. Statistics used to hire a lot but hires less lately.\\n\\nYou usually need an A minus (preferably an A) in the class to teach, and overall decent grades.\\n\\nUsually the track is: tutor -> uGSI OR lab assistant -> tutor-> ugSI. Leads have typically taught 3+ semesters.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Pros of being a uGSI at Cal (note the following is my own individual experience. uGSI experiences vary).**\\n\\n**Responsibility-** uGSIs in Berkeley get an invaluable experience of really teaching and leading their own section and are given a tremendous amount of trust and responsibility. In many colleges, uGSIs just grade or pass out papers, etc. But I‚Äôve had the chance to build actual teaching curriculum, teach my own section the way I'd like, and as a lead, play a major role in shaping the direction of the course. I feel like I actually had an impact on my students and the course as a whole.\\n\\n**Faculty access**\\\\- it‚Äôs a great way to get to know faculty and have access to them as a mentor.\\n\\n**Learning**\\\\- being a uGSI forces you to become much better at the material. You also learn communication skills, emotional intelligence, and how to become a better listener. It is so wonderfully rewarding- I love working with students and helping them gain confidence & love for the material.\\n\\n**Pay-** It pays far better than a typical work-study job (\\\\~$28/hr or so?), you paid fully for the beginning/end months of the semester, and you get some tuition reimbursement (\\\\~30% for 8-hr, almost full for 20-hr).\\n\\n**Cons of position (again only my own experiences):**\\n\\n**Workload**\\\\- it‚Äôs a lot of work- to do it well. Teaching, grading, meetings and office hours will take you to 8-hrs alone. But then add prep, emails, helping students out, etc.I feel like I‚Äôve always had to choose between just doing the work I‚Äôm paid or doing unpaid hours to do the best for my students. It‚Äôs really easy to spend way too long and overwork yourself because you want to do your best for the students.\\n\\n**Learning curve**\\\\- it‚Äôs hard to teach. The resources are limited. One pedagogy course alone won‚Äôt teach you everything you need to know. The responsibilities aren‚Äôt that different from those of teachers at small liberal arts colleges. And you quickly learn two things: (1) you can get an A/A+ in a class and still not truly understand half the material; (2) just knowing the material really well still doesn‚Äôt mean you can teach.\\n\\n**Discrimination/elitism & other interpersonal challenges:** there‚Äôs a lot of racism/sexism/elitism in both the course staffs and the general student body as a whole. So women/poc/first-gen TAs have to deal with that on top of everything else. I have dealt with aggressive students, microaggressions/discrimination, and even flat-out sexism/ sexual harassment from both students and fellow uGSIs, and I  know many other underrepresented staff who have as well.\\n\\n**Tips on recruiting for course staff positions:**\\n\\n1. Engage deeply in the class. Notice I said ‚Äúengage‚Äù- not just get a good grade. Ask/answer a lot on piazza. Get to know your GSIs and your professor. Go to office hours. Actually learn the material- not just what you need to get the A, but understand it at a deep level, understand the big picture...understand it well enough to teach it. And yes, try to get an A as well.\\n2. Get a summer role- they are usually easier to get and can help you ‚Äúclimb‚Äù up the course staff ladder faster.\\n3. Be flexible on which course you teach, especially initially. It can be easier to get into a course staff in a smaller/less popular class, become a uGSI and then jump to another uGSI position. It‚Äôs a lot easier to get a uGSI position anywhere once you make uGSI in some (any) class. You can even switch departments/teach a completely unrelated course, and will still get priority because of your uGSI experience.\\n   1. Obviously, choose a class you would like to teach. But it‚Äôll be harder if you only want cs 61a or bust.\\n4. Choose a good supervisor- an invaluable part of this experience is getting to know faculty. Remember this is your boss- and being a good supervisor is a distinctly different skill from being a good lecturer/teacher, even if they overlap.\\n   1. This applies 10x for a lead TA. You work with the professor very closely in that role. And a lead TA can range from helping the professor with logistics to basically running the entire class for them in their name.\\n\\nOnce you are in a course staff, to ‚Äúgo up the ladder‚Äù:\\n\\n1. Do your work- don‚Äôt be the reader who never turns in things on time. Go to meetings (on time), meet deadlines, get the basics down. Sounds obvious? You‚Äôd be surprised how many people can‚Äôt do that.\\n2. Engage with the teaching community- ask questions, give feedback about how students are feeling, offer suggestions to improve student success in meetings. Built a relationship with the professor & other TAs. Even if you are not a uGSI, you can still give your feedback & suggestions on how best to support students.\\n   1. Obviously, don‚Äôt kiss up- but take advantage of being part of this community. Be genuine about your passion for teaching and ask for help/advice & give feedback- and your passion will come through when hiring decisions are made.\\n   2. And also when recruiting time comes, directly express how interested you are in a specific ugsi position if you know the professor.\\n\\nA final bit of advice:\\n\\nBefore you apply, please reflect on why you would like to be a teacher. This job is hard and you are given significant responsibility. It‚Äôs important that you take the role seriously and treat students with respect and kindness. You can learn to be a better teacher but you cannot ‚Äúteach‚Äù empathy & kindness. That has to come from you and it‚Äôs absolutely essential.\\n\\nRemember, you might be the worlds next Turing award winner, but if you don‚Äôt have compassion for students and passion to help them succeed, nothing else matters.\\n\\nI love being a uGSI. It‚Äôs genuinely my favorite part of Cal and it‚Äôs the thing I will miss the most. It's also the hardest thing I've done at Cal. My students taught me so much and most are a joy to work with. I highly recommend that everyone apply and try out teaching at some point :) .\\n\\nIf you are an underrepresented student, especially, please apply! We need more ugsis from all backgrounds that reflect the diversity of experience and backgrounds of our students!\\n\\nI hope this helps anyone interested in teaching at Cal. Please DM me if you have any questions :) .\",\n",

Even during peak of the pandemic I chose to stay in Berkeley. Coming home and being trapped in the house with my mother, I just realize how extremely toxic she is.

       "  \"*To preface, if you check my* [*og post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tn8o9m/heard_cs_department_is_considering_to_remove_eecs/)*, I posted about the 16B vote long before Prof. Hug announced it through email, cause I have many friends that talk to the board.*\\n\\nHeard from a couple board members: the CS department has already fully voted to remove EECS16b, but the delay in announcement is cause the EE faculty are voicing concerns and are very unhappy with the decision.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**The Two Sides**\\n\\nA: CS faculty that voted yes\\n\\nThe argument from this ring is that EECS 16B has very little to do with a pure Computer Science major. A few years ago EECS16b was never required for CS students in the first place, since they were not electrical engineering majors.\\n\\nNow because they have arbitrarily inserted an EE class into the wrong major, the class is rated abysmally low compared to relative CS courses, because the majority of students (even those that ace the class) and many CS faculty know that EECS16B has very little relevance to the rest of a pure CS major.\\n\\nThe main sentiment is that they are burning money and worsening the CS financial crisis for a class that nobody wants and is from the wrong major. Although this won't solve the entire budget, it will still cause a significant boost in EECS class resources, TA hiring, and accessibility to classes for everyone.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nB: EE faculty that are against it\\n\\nThere are many EE faculty that are fighting the vote, because they bring up the argument that Computer Science is inextricably tied to electrical engineering. They believe that EECS 16B is considered a basic prerequisite, as a holistic 16A and 16B experience is crucial to laying a fundamental foundation in EE, which is highly relevant to CS.\\n\\nEE is the roots and origins of CS, and has many useful engineering applications in the industry. Their argument is that the greatest possible change should only be an improved version of the course, where they will try to improve some topics etc., but removal should never be allowed.\\n\\nI was told that the more under-the-cover sentiment is that if EECS16B is removed, this might remove a potential pipeline of students that they would need for their own EE classes and might impact their own livelihood, as they need EE to always be tied to CS. Because of this they don't want their classes limited to just EECS majors, but also CS majors that aren't EE.\\n\\nPersonally if the second sentiment is really true I don't really agree with it as much, but I am kind of a nerd for circuits and electrical engineering. I agree that EE is the roots of CS and gives you some of the most fascinating theory out there. Whether or not you think inserting EE into a pure CS major at the cost of EECS class resources is right though is something I leave up to you to decide.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**What's Next?**\\n\\nThe vote was going to pass but now it will potentially be delayed for many months. This will probably prevent a financial surplus to help all EECS/CS students more easily get into their classes and get resources.\\n\\n**Since the vast majority of undergrad students have skipped EECS16b for the Fall (cause it might be removed and CS students hate it), and also due to the whole P/NP mess, it is likely that, even if somehow 16b stays, they will allow Juniors and Seniors (no restriction for all years) to take it cause otherwise there would be a class wide enrollment crisis (having to forcibly manually insert hundreds).**\\n\\n**If you don't want to take 16b, you potentially might not want to yet, since (even if 16b stays) they will let you take it later and it is still likely to be waived. So you might prematurely be wasting up to 20+ hours a week for content the CS department has voted as irrelevant and hurtful to your CS education, when waiting has little consequence.**\\n\\nThere are many students directing anger at the CS department for the delay, but please understand that it is not their fault. They have already voted, now things have just gotten dicey with faculty pushback.\\n\\nI also want to give a shoutout to Cindy Conners, cause she has done a tremendous job but has often been harrowed by many students for enrollment issues from the CS policy change and also EECS16b. Remember that she is a messenger and most of the CS faculty are just as subject to these unexpected worldly events that we are. We are all human, and everyone is trying their best.\\n\\n**I wanted to write this post to shed more light on the situation so everyone can better plan, and also make it clear to everyone that the CS department is not purposely trying to drag this out. We can all be patient.** If you feel such a need to do something, stop protesting the CS department, cause they voted yes and things are out of their hands.\\n\\nIf anything I feel that the CS department has done a fantastic job, considering how complicated it has been to navigate this budget deficit. I hope this post sheds more light and keeps everyone more informed.\",\n",

       "  'Hi, I\\'m Ani, a former TA for 70 and former JM/SM/AM/CM for CS 70. When I was at Berkeley, I thought about 70 a lot, and tried to make change for the better as much I could. A long time ago (3 years ago) I tried to help solve this problem, and got shut down. In this post, I will try to give my thoughts on the course as it stands.\\n\\nCore Idea: TL;DR 70 as a course could and should be split in two. It won\\'t be until CS is able to scale. \\n\\n#### What is the issue with 70?\\n\\nGenerally, there are a few main issues students have with 70.\\n1. The course material is challenging\\n2. The course gives students a lot of stress.\\n3. Students feel they are missing the point of the course\\n\\nI don\\'t think anyone would have a problem if the course material was challenging if they weren\\'t stressed and they understood why the material was important. \\n\\nPoint 2 is the one that is most discussed. The problem is generally agreed to be that there is too much content in the course, rather than too much workload. This is despite end of course surveys indicating that students spending a lot more time on this course than they \"should\" on a four unit course. 70 occasionally has no homework options, but at the end of the day **understanding content takes too much time **.\\n\\nPoint 3 is important, despite the lack of discussion. Why are stable matching and graph theory in a course called discrete math and probability? Isn\\'t it full enough already? Why Berlekamp-Welsh? Computability? Markov chains aren\\'t even taught half the time, and are taught better in 126 anyway. \\n\\nIt all does fit together in a way. I\\'ve debated with plenty of people what should and should be included, but students should know why they are learning what they are learning, and how ideas go together. Unfortunately, most people who do figure out how the pieces fit together do so when they are teaching the course.\\n\\nOn a whim, I checked what the stated goals for CS 70 was this semester. Rao tends to start off by explaining how far reaching discrete math and probability are, but he recently added this goal:\\n\\n\"We teach you to think more clearly and more powerfully.  \\n..And to deal clearly with uncertainty itself\"\\n\\nThe point of 70 is to expand your way of thinking, and to give you a conceptual understanding of discrete math and probability. **The glut of topics in 70 forces students to spend so much time on the material that they are unable to focus on learning how to learn, deeper understanding, or forming an interconnected conceptual map.**\\n\\n#### A solution I worked on\\nA long time ago, I guest lectured for a friend\\'s decal called Introduction to Mathematical Thinking. The creator of the course was one of those people who inspires you to your core. Who seems to just, for a moment, break open what you think possible. \\n\\nWe had talked about how 70 sometimes failed students. Although we would never admit it at the time to avoid trouble, the IMT decal was a solution to that: create a course where students had a much slower pace, and worked on a different set of concepts. There was a little overlap with 70, but there was much less content.\\n\\nThe course was roughly three times slower than 70. It was a decal. There were occasional review lectures. It was focused on learning how to learn.\\n\\nStudents really liked it. Demand was through the roof. It got shut down because it gave some students an unfair edge in the declaration process, and admission to the decal was controlled by students. \\n\\n#### What is the real problem?\\n\\nCS at Berkeley is broke. It is criminally underfunded for its size, an issue that countless people have talked about. This leads to the declaration process, which leads to a counterproductive incentive structure for students. \\n\\nLearning how to learn and learning how you learn dense technical subjects both take time. When you read the notes or go to lecture for the first time, half the lecture might make no sense. This isn\\'t a failure of the lecture / notes, but part of the process. You aren\\'t supposed to go to lecture and understand everything or all the things you are supposed to know, and this is scary. It\\'s hard to start creating a conceptual map of what you know when you don\\'t even know the full extent of what you are supposed to know. It is a skill. It takes time to learn.\\n\\nStudents are not incentivized to do this, because they feel trying to do so would make them fall behind. For most, just understanding what is being said in the lecture or note takes as much time as most other classes. Afterwards, they don\\'t know where to start to create a flexible understanding. With the time they have left they use the skills they learned in other courses: memorize, write everything on your cheat sheet, and copy and paste what is relevant. It tends to be insufficient for homework and tests.\\n\\nPeople who retake 70 by using their emergency late drop tend to do much better the second time. Their understanding of the course is deeper than it was the first time because they already have a vague understanding of the material, and are able to spend their time on deeper understanding.\\n\\n**If the department had the funds, they could allow people who didn\\'t make the grade cutoff to retake the course without spending an emergency late drop. They could split the course in two. They could make a CS 10 equivalent for CS 70. Unfortunately, all of these solutions require spending more money per student, and Berkeley EECS does not have that luxury.**\\n\\nAs a result, until funding issues are resolved, 70 will stay in an unhealthy state for students. \\n\\n#### Counterarguments to various takes I have seen\\n\\n**It is a resource problem:** 70 has more resources than many courses in the department. 61A/B have more resources, true, but students already have enough resources to spend >15 hours understanding the material per week. For a course like 70, you should probably be spending roughly half your time understanding the material and half of your time poking and prodding at your understanding, trying to deepen it. Ideally, notes and lecture give understanding where discussions and homework deepen it. In practice, everything but homework is where students learn the material, and they lack the time to deepen it. \\n\\n**More staff would solve the issue**. The only area where TA support was ever an issue was peak demand office hours. The reason there is so much demand for office hours the last day is the pace of the course and the lack of depth of understanding students have going in to days of homework. Most OH and discussions are underutilized (see advice below).\\n\\n**If the course was easier people would just procrastinate it for other work.** Possibly, maybe even probably. But revisiting concepts and repetition - which is hard to do with the pace of 70 - is essential to learning. And workloads for the course on average exceed the four unit \"12 hours per week\". I don\\'t think the course should be easier, just that it should be slower. If you procrastinate studying to the last day, you will be in just as much trouble as before.\\n\\n**It prepares students for upper div rigor.** 70 is harder than most of the upper divs when you factor in the experience of the people who take it. Many upperclassmen will say that 70 was the hardest course for them when they took it. My roommate took 70 twice and got an A+ in 189. Anecdotal and atypical evidence but true.\\n\\n**Some students want more rigor.** If you want a fast pace, take five techs. Your goal is to reach upper divs as fast as possible, so take a course in both the CS61 and EE16 series. To beef up your conceptual understanding skills, take a course in the Physics 5 series. Finally, add a math course on there. I have heard great things about 110. Your courseload will have sufficient rigor even with an easier 70.\\n\\n#### Addendum: Actual advice for taking 70\\n\\nThree years ago (time flies!) I was one of the writers for the CSM worksheets. Here is some advice I wrote back in the day, with edits:\\n\\n1. Don\\'t fall behind. Homework will become a miserable experience because you will try to learn and digest content at the same time.\\n2. Do make use of resources: join CSM, and come to office hours 2 days or more before the homework deadline.\\n3. Experiment with study schedules. I like notes for gist -> lecture -> notes to check understanding -> discussion -> notes to figure out what I thought I understood but didn\\'t -> do hw -> get stuck -> figure exactly what I\\'m stuck on -> go to OH/ HW Party and and get unstuck -> go back to \"do hw\"\\n4. Do find people to work with, but understand everything on your own. Homework matters too little pointwise for copying to help you.\\n5. Mathematical intuition is a fancy word for this process\\n\\t1. Understand the problem.\\n\\t2. Think of all the techniques you have at your disposal\\n\\t3. Try to match the different techniques to the problem based on previous problems you have solved\\n\\t4. If one leads to an answer, check if it makes sense\\n6. If you are planning on taking this course in the future and want to prepare, try to teach yourself the \"gist\" of everything now, where you are able to attempt the discussions. Then when you take it, focus on how to tackle problems and how concepts fit together.\\n7. Most discussions, at least when I taught, had quite low attendance. Prime time discussions (soon after lecture and in a convenient spot) were highly attended, but my first semester TAing I taught in genetics plant biology the day after. The first day there were only ~10 attendees, and I consistently had 2-3 people for most of the semester. If you are in the course, go to an unpopulated discussion and office hour and try to get the equivalent of conceptual 1 on 1 tutoring. The resource is available, not utilized (at least when I taught).\\n8. There is no such thing as \"fully understanding.\" You can teach the course and take grad level content in the area and still have more to learn. Once you think you can wrap your head around a concept, try to find the holes in your understanding, and rinse and repeat. Ask why like an annoying toddler.\\n9. You belong here, and every TA and mentor is happy you are taking this course. We hope to see you around!',\n",

I thought it was just small talk and didn't pay much attention. He put his hand on top of mine; I felt uncomfortable but I didn't want to be rude since it might have been normal for his culture. He first asked me if I liked middle easterns then asked where I'm from. He then talked about how he lived in Berkeley for 24 years and has a house in the middle east and one in Berkeley. He then went on about how great he was at massages. I was quite uncomfortable but I was near my stop and was ready to get off. When I got off, he followed me.\\n\\nWhen we got off he kept trying to talk to me and the bus driver honked at him since he had a bike in the front. I tried to get away from him but I was at a crosswalk waiting for the signal. While waiting, he asked if I wanted a massage and I said no. I quickly crossed but again he followed and again I was waiting for the crosswalk signal. He then asked how big my penis was and I tried ignoring him. Once the signal turned green I was really uncomfortable and was walking away as fast as I could. He asked me a couple times if I wanted to go somewhere with him. I kept saying no then he said he would give me $200 if I showed him my penis. I kept saying no until he finally stopped following me.\\n\\nI'm grateful that nothing terrible happened to me and I hope I can be more assertive in the future.

       "  'Taking a summer cs class right now and *man* this stuff is hard. And it just feels that it takes me so. much. more. longer. than the average student here (or even most of the students) to just get the same work done. I eventually do finish the assignments / readings / projects but it\\'s as if my capacity for work is noticeably lower than basically everyone else :(. \\n\\nEverything\\'s a slog. I literally have to read through the instructions word by word out loud to myself, annotate stuff on my IDE, and ask for so many clarifications on piazza and/or office hours. I need extensions on every single assignment - it\\'s the default 2-day extension granted by staff so no penalties but I feel bad when I need to avail myself of that thing 2 times a week. I mean, deadlines are meant to be adhered to, and it\\'s expected that they are reasonable. In 162 group projects, I manage to pull my weight but it just takes days longer than my own group members. \\n\\nI just wish that I was... \\\\*smarter\\\\*. I wish it took me a bit less time to process information and deeply understanding it. I\\'ve tried reading instructions and jumping into the assignment but invariably I end up missing an important detail, or find out that I had a misconception that I need to go ask in office hours. In general, I find that people are just able to \\\\*connect\\\\* ideas so much faster. When I took CS 70 last, I had to re-read the notes, go through discussion worksheets, and do a LOT of brainstorming in order to finish a single problem - while a lot of people were able to go \"oh this was seen in lecture, and the notes example goes through a similar problem, so we can do \\\\*this\\\\* to solve it\". And the process never became easier with time, as even if my intelligence/problem solving ability increased with time, the course material (not just CS 70 but future coursework) also increases with difficulty - leaving me struggling to stay afloat. I feel like I\\'m pulling out all the stops to... survive here.  \\n\\nHow the hell do people manage to do other extracurriculars, do well in academics, go through the recruiting grind, *and not go insane in the process?* I\\'m in two academic/tech-oriented clubs - one\\'s project based (\\\\~8 hrs / week) and the other is more of a label than anything else, maybe a few hours of work per week. I was able to get a research position last semester (more of a solo project w/o too much oversight so this is kind of lowkey), and I\\'m also involved in another non-technical position in my major\\'s dept. Combining this with academics (and recruiting ohmygawd) - I am *floundering.* I just can\\'t üò≠.  \\n\\nI\\'m compulsive about deadlines and stuff so beyond the occasional week when deadlines clash, I\\'m not super stressed out constantly. I make sure to get a bit more than 6 hours of sleep everyday and I like my major and the stuff I\\'m doing so it\\'s not like I\\'m miserable or anything.  But \"not miserable\" is not exactly an enviable state of mind to be in. I haven\\'t made any good memories with people. I haven\\'t enjoyed my time here. I feel that when I graduate, I\\'ll just go \"thank fucking god I\\'m out of here\" and not really have good/nostalgic moments to look back on which kind of sucks. \\n\\nI feel that I have to do all this to put myself in the best possible position to get into a good master\\'s program and later get a job with a reasonable balance of work-satisfaction + compensation + work-life-balance. I do have a creeping doubt that if I do get a job where people say there\\'s good work life balance, I might still be floundering as my baseline... capacity? intelligence? idk. is lower than average. But that\\'s another discussion lol. \\n\\nNot sure what I\\'m looking for here, but just wanted to get it out.

       "  \"Hi everyone. I just finished up the Economics major at Cal this week :) !! I wrote up a guide to the entire major in case its helpful to any current or future economics majors. Please note that all of this is my personal opinion only.\\n\\nReview: I loved the economics major at Cal overall. The department has some star researchers, and also many incredible teachers (with some overlap of the two). The difficulty is reasonable, and I had a lot of autonomy in choosing/customizing my coursework/path/difficulty. There are quite a bit of research opportunities as well. However, advising is rather poor imo- advising is understaffed, it's difficult to get appointments, and response times can be slow. Class sizes are large (100-500 people).\\n\\nThe major is rather short ,leaving you plenty of time to take fun classes, minor or double major. I found having a strong statistics/math foundation makes the major much easier.\\n\\n# Pre-requisite classes:\\n\\n**Econ 1/2**: the introductory economics classes. You only take one. The difference between the two is that econ 2 has more hours of lecture, and less discussion, and is generally more difficult. I would recommend Econ 2 over Econ 1, as I think it prepares you better for the major, and the professors (romers) are good lecturers and very well-known economists.\\n\\n**Math 1a/1b or 16a/16b:** I tested out using Calc BC. I'll let someone else pipe in about those classes. Calculus is essential in economics, so take this requirement seriously.\\n\\n**Stats requirement:** one of the following-\\n\\n* STAT 20, STAT 21, STAT W21, STAT 88/DATA C88S, STAT C131A, STAT 135, *or* STAT C140\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nNote: stat 88 changed its name to data c88s since it moved to the data science department.\\n\\nMost people don't take an upper-division stats class for this requirement - typically they take either stat 20 or stat 88/data c88s. Stat 88 has a (typically enforced) co-requisite of data 8 so you have to take data 8 with stat 88 to fulfill the requirement. But only stat 88 counts in the GPA cap.\\n\\nBoth stat 20 and stat 88 are hard classes- although imo stat 88 is harder. Some of my professors noted that Data 8 + stat 88 together will likely prepare you better for the stats in the major than stat 20 alone. But it's more work + units.\\n\\n**One of econ 100a/101a; 100b/101b; 140: see section on core upper-division classes**\\n\\n**How hard is it to declare?** You need a 3.0 in the pre-requisites for freshman, 2.7 for transfers. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too hard. The hardest pre-requisite is statistics, which is the biggest barrier to declaring.\\n\\nThe pre-requisites are a good sense of the major, and I do think a strong foundation in calculus, stats and lower-division economics is essential to success in the major.\\n\\n# Intermediate Core Economics Classes:\\n\\nThere‚Äôs 3: microeconomics (econ 100a/101a); macroeconomics (econ 100b/101b); econometrics (140/141).\\n\\nThe consensus seems to be: macroeconomics < (?) microeconomics <<<<< econometrics in terms of difficulty. \\n\\nThere‚Äôs two tracks: normal (econ 100a/100b/140) and math-intensive/honors (101a/101b/141). You can mix and match from both tracks (as I did). I found the math-intensive classes to be a better experience (smaller class sizes; better professors; a lot of students are really engaged/usually are interested in a phd in economics; the material felt more interesting). But they were much harder (especially the gap between 140 to 141).\\n\\nMicro is slightly more math-heavy than macro, econometrics is much more math-heavy than both of them.\\n\\nEconometrics (which is essentially just stats) is the hardest class typically in the major. It‚Äôs difficult, theoretical, and typically poorly taught. However, I found that with a strong stats/math/data science background, Econ 140 wasn‚Äôt too bad. The jump from stat 20/other stats classes (alone with no other stats classes) to econometrics is tough, but doable!\\n\\nThis felt like the most ‚Äúboring‚Äù part of the economics major, and anecdotally, the time when a lot of people drop out of the major. Things feel too theoretical/dry sometimes, you have little choice in your coursework. I personally enjoyed my electives much more. I found these 3 classes to be a strong base for the rest of my degree, though.\\n\\n# Electives! :\\n\\nNow you have basically complete freedom! I suggest you do a mini-specialization. Find what makes you excited- I personally don‚Äôt like macroeconomics as much and love applied microeconomics (labor, education, etc) and so I took more of the later.   Here are some electives I or my friends took. (please chime in the comments on other econ electives):\\n\\nEcon 136- financial economics. very popular and good class. Hawkins is a good professor. Might be useful for finance careers, but it is very theoretical and can be dry if you aren‚Äôt interested in finance.\\n\\nEcon 172: economic development in sub-saharan africa. Fantastic class. Professor Miguel is a world-renowned economist and an amazing lecturer & teacher. Super interesting material. Very empirical/statistics-based with almost no theory. Econ 140 is not a pre-req but should be - take econometrics before.\\n\\nEcon 152: labor economics! My personal favorite part of economics :) . interesting applications in people‚Äôs life- like welfare, unemployment, education, discrimination, etc. Completely applied micro, so make sure you take econ 100a/101a before. I took it with Professor Walters and he was a really great professor!\\n\\nEcon c152: Basically an advanced econometrics class. Need a very strong statistics base.  A very useful class with interesting policy applications and very good for research. Professor Card often teaches it.\\n\\nEcon c175: demography econ. probably the easiest economics class. Very low workload, very relaxed. Material can be interesting, although dry lectures.\\n\\nEcon 157: health econ. Also one of the easier classes. Combination of theory and empirics, interesting/important questions about health systems.\\n\\nEcon 134: economic history of recessions. This is heavily macro-focused (take econ 100b/101b before). Usually taught by good professor/well-known macroeconomists (eg nakamura). Important questions about the causes, history of, and monetary/fiscal response to recessions.\\n\\nNote: you can also take classes outside of the economics department to count to the requirement if it‚Äôs in the list of classes in the department website.  You can also petition a course and I found it very easy to do so (petitioned a course that was barely econ related that was approved).\\n\\nEcon Grad classes: grad classes don‚Äôt count towards any econ requirement, but you can take them for fun. 1st-year grad classes are typically hard and weeders- check prereqs (eg real analysis) carefully and make sure you are prepared. 2nd year classes are to prepare PhD students for dissertations in a specific sub-sector of economics, and typically are heavy on literature reading and presentations. I took a 2nd-year econ grad class and loved it. You need permission from the professor- I suggest taking the undergrad version of the course, doing really well, and then asking the professor for permission. Expect a huge learning curve, even if you coasted through the undergrad version of the class- you will need to spend a ton of time and still feel very behind. But I found it worth it.\\n\\nHope this is helpful! Please let me know if you have any questions! And please chime in the comments if you have anything to add, correct or any additional advice!\",\n",

This way, rather than being inserted at the end of the queue (usually 50-60th in line), I could be inserted at the top of the stack and be the first in line to get checked off.

I hadn\\'t developed self discipline or grounding techniques to do well in the outside world. Growing is painful and when you go to a school like Berkeley underprepared not just academically but emotionally, you\\'ll struggle. I know I did. I ultimately fell down this spiral my first year there and I eventually stopped showing up to classes because of it. I couldn\\'t care about studying. No amount of motivational videos could get me to turn in those missing assignments. What I needed was discipline. That\\'s what gets you through this. I remember I went on this whole \"I HATE BERKELEY\" warpath and I blamed the school for my lack of ability. That\\'s not the case at all. I know a lot of people who fall under this mindset at the school. Just because you failed the assignment doesn\\'t mean it was the professors fault. Take accountability and do better next time. Form a routine and be consistent. You don\\'t have to be 100% all the time. If you are consistent at 80%, you are still making progress. It\\'s much better than being 100% every other time. I also made the mistake of overworking myself. As an FGLI student I was spending like 25+ hours a week working which caused me to neglect school. Find balance. I didn\\'t make an effort to go make friends or go to parties or even go to brunch with people close to me. I regret that but it\\'s not too late. Alone time is cool, but if you put yourself out there you can learn so much more. Are you awkward? Me too. We all are. Ultimately I made the decision to come home and do community college after my first year and it wasn\\'t all a piece of cake. There were a lot of things I needed to learn.

Then, I‚Äôm able to deliver her food to her by her RH building main door and she‚Äôs able to use her cane to walk up to that main door and get her food.\\n\\nAs for all the other events, she insisted that she was totally ok with staying in her RH and not going to any of the events for the entire GBO such as the company-visit/excursion since everyone including me had to go to their own but yeah she was fine with it.\\n\\nFinally, as for the most important assistance that she needs (food and getting safely to all her classes starting 08/24): It looks like her RH (which is a single and has her own bathroom) is located in such a way that she is easily able to access her local dining hall right next to her RH! (It was only GBO food locations that was an entire mess because she was unable to eat on her local dining hall next to her cuz apparently, it was reserved for other groups, but fortunately, it‚Äôs gonna get waaay better after GBO, that is, she won‚Äôt need me to deliver food to her after GBO anymore).\\n\\nAs for her classes, she told me she spoke to her counselor and they talked about getting all her Professors to release a recording of the lectures online for her to access and so she wouldn‚Äôt need to come to campus AT ALL, which she says would be a great help.

He was a CS prof at UCLA. I thought to myself hmmm, I know another Sahai that\\'s a CS professor and they looked a bit alike - are they related?\\n\\nSo I set off on my research journey.

Through some other website that contained perhaps too much information, I learned that Prof Anant Sahai was born about 2 years before Amit. Across both space and time, so far evidence seem to confirm my hypothesis. However, it could all be a coincidence and information could be wrong, so I have to have solid proof, so I wasn\\'t 100% convinced.\\n\\nThen, I stumbled upon [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/24x0d9/professor_anant_sahai_as_a_berkeley_undergraduate/) reddit post, where a LA Times article back the 1990s was linked. In the article, we know that Prof Anant Sahai was a \\\\*Thousand Oaks\\\\* HS Senior at the time of writing. and in the AMA Prof Anant Sahai referred to his \\\\*brother\\\\* multiple times. He mentioned that his brother came to Berkeley a little later than him, confirming the aforementioned age difference. He also mentioned winning the ACM with him (very impressive), and guess what? The wikipedia article says Prof Amit Sahai also won that too. Very cool stuff.\\n\\nSo yeah I spent half an hour of my life to comprehensively prove that Prof Sahai has a younger brother that teaches CS at UCLA. Looking back at it I think the conclusion is already fairly conclusive just because they look alike but what do I know. Also, if one of the Prof Sahai\\'s reads this and doesn\\'t like it, I\\'ll be happy to take it down. Thanks for coming to my TED talk',\n",
       "  'I\\'m reposting this and prepared for all negative comments but this is something I firmly believe in and refuse to stand down.\\n\\n\\\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSeems crazy, right? Why would I pass up the opportunity to get the best CS degree in the world?\\n\\n**For context, I am an international student from a tiny country.** Statistically speaking, your EECSperience is likely to be way different to mine.\\n\\nThe two classes that sealed the deal for me were, not coincidentally at all, the only two classes with a bona fide curve: 70 and 170. No matter what I did, I just felt that my position on the curve was never going to be a function of my effort because I would always be outshone by the people that know this stuff better.\\n\\nIn fact, the way both those classes are designed with the rounding up of HW score means that if you know your stuff you\\'re basically guaranteed full marks on every HW. And if you don\\'t know your stuff your only option is to leech off of others in OH and/or find a study group of people that do know their stuff. For 70, this feeling was very pronounced because it was all online and I barely knew anyone at Cal. I felt truly alone, and after two weeks I caved and switched to the no-HW option. And despite still attempting some of the questions every week, participating actively in every discussion section, religiously reading notes in advance of lecture, and asking (and answering) questions on Piazza, I would still get outclassed on what mattered most - the exams. \\n\\nEveryone just seemed to have something I didn\\'t. Could it be... this so-called \"mathematical maturity\"???? Of course it was! The phrase may be a meme but it feels real to me, mainly because of how evidently I lack it. This kind of stuff seems to take years to perfect, and we don\\'t have years when taking these classes. Every time a 70 question would pull a random math trick out of nowhere (like wtf is a triangle inequality?) I would sit there really confused on how they got it. But in truth everyone knew how to do it because it was a question on the 20xx \\\\[insert math olympiad name here\\\\].\\n\\nMy experience in 170 was arguably worse. It was in-person so I could go to OH and I ultimately did find a study group, but I\\'m not sure any of that helped my alleged impostor syndrome. OH was just a breeding ground for anxiety, not least when many people there weren\\'t even speaking English to each other. As for my study group, I was always the one getting carried and I never felt like I was learning anything. There were to be no points for how many in-person lectures I went to and how many pages of notes I took. In what mattered most - the graded assignments - I had naught. Since everyone was getting full marks on the HW, if I couldn\\'t work it out I would fall massively behind curve-wise. If I did well on an exam, it was likely because it was easy and everyone else did well. And if it was a hard exam, well........ yeah no I had a bad mental breakdown mid-final and got an embarrassingly low score.  I\\'m glad the class\\'s policy on failing is so generous because in another class I probably would\\'ve failed.\\n\\nI hear you cry: *This is college. Toughen up. You\\'re not going to be the A student you may have been in high school.* True, but there\\'s something about the utter cesspool that Berkeley CS can sometimes be which frightens me. This culture of being the \"best\" or \"only\" major and the constant craving for the outrageously high salaries that SWEs make is getting annoying. And it seems like everyone I know is focused on that track. I have to say I admire people that can truly grind like that, but the gap between myself and everyone else is so wide. The place I grew up in just didn\\'t have enough competitive programming and math opportunities to build up my skills to the level that the average CS student I meet here has. But I suppose this is what you get when you go to the number one university in the world.\\n\\nDo I feel like I learned something in 70 and 170? Yes, of course. They were good classes that just didn\\'t happen to work out for me. Prof. Nelson is easily the best lecturer I\\'ve ever had here. And I don\\'t want to sound like these issues are exclusive to international students and common with all of them. I\\'m sure I speak for plenty of other underserved minorities in the CS space that may have faced the same barriers to entry that I did. This is a real issue that needs to be tackled, and I\\'m all for more diversity. \\n\\nMy schedule for the spring is very varied and unusual, but it\\'s full of things I genuinely like. I really hope I find my place here soon, but what I can confidently say as of now is that it\\'s not in CS.',\n",

That\\'s 75 hours a week. Nobody should spend that time, let alone even 40 hours on a course per week. That\\'s definitely physically and mentally unhealthy.\\n\\n**students with prior exposure to competitive or rigorous math at any level pre-college whether it‚Äôs USAMO, USACO, AIME, AMC or multivariable/linear algebra at a local college have a MASSIVE advantage**\\n\\nThis is true. This goes for literally any class ever. People who studied the subject in high school are going to do better. There\\'s not too much anyone can do about that, as this content is core to CS curriculum. I agree that it becomes an issue when the *only* people getting good grades are people with prior experience. However, this is simply not true. By far, the *majority* of people I know who have received A, A-, and B+\\'s (declaring-quality grades) in 70 have no prior high-level math experience as you have described or even went to a Silicon Valley high school. The majority who have earned A+\\'s have comp math experience, but that\\'s a feasibly irrelevant category. Many students can do it; they put in the work. They definitely have trouble with it and spend countless hours on it, and it is a source of stress, but the CS 70 curve is honestly really generous and they tend to pull through.\\n\\n**The course is WAY TOO FAST-PACED yet expects students to be able to reproduce every proof from a note that we read the day before.**\\n\\nThis is the crux of what you are trying to say. You talk about going step-by-step, adding color to the notes, adding length and depth to explanations, and other improvements that essentially add time to the course. Truly, you want the course to be split into two courses. One on discrete math and one on probability theory. That\\'s fine and that\\'s entirely fair. And that\\'s what they do at like 98+% of universities in the nation (or they expect half the depth in each area). But this is Berkeley, and a lot of the brightest CS/EECS students come here to be challenged, to learn theory, to gain the skills needed for research or highly technical work, or all of the above. If this course format truly doesn\\'t float your boat, I\\'m going to be entirely frank and say maybe you should study a different major at Berkeley or study CS at literally any other university (other than like CMU, MIT, etc.). You seem like an excellent writer, probably better than any (EE)CS major I\\'ve met so far. Maybe use those strengths to your advantage.\\n\\nOther universities will teach you significantly less theory at a much slower pace with much lower expectations. You\\'ll probably learn to write mobile apps or web apps in some of your classes (look at Cal Poly\\'s curriculum, for example). Berkeley asks its students to learn theory instead because it believes that strong theoretical foundations will make learning those skills trivial. A lot of students come here instead of those schools because they crave depth and challenge. They don\\'t care about highlighted theorems or color-coded notes too much.\\n\\n**An overwhelming majority of students will tell you that lecture is useless (supported by student survey data as well) and it‚Äôs motivated by a variety of factors.**\\n\\nI concede. Lectures aren\\'t great when they are just slides. Math needs to be learned on a blackboard/whiteboard. I think the notes are an excellent and succinct alternative though; I know a lot of students who swear by them.\\n\\n**The notes are massive time sinks that are unnecessarily convoluted and overly complex for no reasons. The argument that this is how math is presented and that other courses later on will be way worse are bad cop-outs for putting in actual work into synthesizing and boiling down material into layman terms that people (undergrads) can actually understand**\\n\\nNobody said the notes were easy. However, from what I have heard, CS 70 notes are considered to be the gold standard for effective, succinct course material. Much better than most textbooks would be. I truly haven\\'t heard this take from anyone. Obviously, there is room for improvement always, but I haven\\'t heard the majority of students suggest they need to be completely rethought. Maybe other students can comment on this.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI don\\'t want to make this too long, but you tend to cite a lot of examples from the equivalent courses at other top CS institutions. Being entirely frank: If you are struggling with CS 70 with 900 hours (75 hours per week, nearly 2 FULL-TIME JOBS), you are probably gonna have a similarly difficult time doing well at MIT, CMU, Stanford, and the other places you cite as having good course materials.\\n\\nI\\'m not trying to gatekeep CS at all. Everyone should be able to learn CS. But maybe Berkeley isn\\'t the right place for you to learn CS given all the time you have spent on this one course. Students will always pick the college that is the most \"prestigious\" of those they get into, but I feel like they often forget that fit is important too. CS at Berkeley is probably not the fit you are looking for, especially if you are interested in being physically and mentally healthy. And I don\\'t think Berkeley should decrease its rigor to accommodate for this, because there are plenty of students who need and crave this rigor.',\n",

Girls are making it clear that *they don‚Äôt like it*, and you just keep saying ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs normal and fine and others do it too, so we‚Äôll keep being like this‚Äù?? \\nAren‚Äôt you just literally telling girls their feelings and fears don‚Äôt matter and only what YOU think is right matters, and that entitles you, a male, to keep scaring them? \\n‚Äî if you agree with this, you are a capitalized oppressor of patriarchalism and a misogynist, and that is very pathetic of you. (edit: by capitalized oppressor I meant OPPRESSOR)\\n\\nOf course, you need to approach people to talk to them. BUT HOW?? Are you doing it in a natural way that makes people feel comfortable?

Ask yourself which is legitimate and okay dude?!?!\\n\\nFinal edit: aside from my angry output above due to some specific comments, I think I‚Äôve been very specific about those particular approaching scenarios - when you approach a girl in a way that makes her feel uncomfortable or even feel scared, such as what this guy did to multiple girls, that is not okay. In case it‚Äôs not clear enough, I‚Äôm not ‚Äúshooting men down for respectfully approaching girls‚Äù. No. Nothing wrong with approaching if you‚Äôre doing it respectfully without making it an uncomfortable situation for the person you‚Äôre interacting with. It depends on HOW you approach them. The way this guy did it, again, not okay. But if you know you‚Äôre approaching someone you‚Äôre interested in with respect and you‚Äôre doing it properly, I wish you all the best and I hope good things will happen between you two! :)',\n",

As many Bears are, he seems to have been an extraordinary and vibrant person. Even a brief google search reveals the following:        \\n- An article about how he and others returned to his high school to serve on a [panel to offer advice and mentorship to younger students](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/story/2022-01-19/college-unplugged-aims-to-help-students-make-decision-on-future%3F_amp%3Dtrue).         \\n- A [Festival of The Arts Audition Video](https://youtu.be/RhC4-j4rcJI).            \\n- it appears he also played tennis and surfed short board (which is often much more technical than long board surfing). [‚ÄúOther standouts in shortboard were Jeremy Shutts taking a 1st and Luca Elghanayan looking really solid to take a 3rd.‚Äù](https://www.lagunabeachindy.com/lbhs-dominates-surf-competition/).         \\n- [This Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca_abeqOjKt/?igshid=YTM0ZjI4ZDI=) indicates that he also gave back to the school of Chemistry during the ‚Äúbig give‚Äù. Whether it was his own money or his family‚Äôs, he certainly made a decision to improve conditions and invest in Cal, investments that often are not felt by current students but enjoyed by those who come many years later.       \\n       \\nI‚Äôve been listening to the YouTube video of his audition and although I don‚Äôt know him at all, I‚Äôve teared up knowing our community lost a member like this. His piano skills are somewhat unrefined, and I don‚Äôt imagine he was classically trained, but he plays piano just like I do: with much more spirit than skill, and with much more feeling than technicality. He‚Äôs playing bohemian rhapsody, not Bach or Beethoven. He and I went to high school <10 miles from each other, and hell, maybe surfed some of the same waves. May he Rest In Peace.',\n",

I was really for that, and had worked with other black community organizations before and was ready to keep doing my best. It was also my only housing option. I lived there for a year and tried to help the house a lot; I did extra workshift hours and helped the kitchen manager and workshift manager weekly. In the person to person connections, it was great.

In the same meeting they would also thank me for the work I was doing for the house and say I was ‚Äòsetting the standard‚Äô. One time one of my roommates in our house counsel meeting told me that I was harming her experience because she didn‚Äôt want a white roommate. When I switched rooms the next semester to live with someone else that was not black because, you know, I didn‚Äôt want my old roommate to keep up the super passive aggressive stuff she was doing, they made a fuss about that and also told my new roommate to not come back in the next semester. It was a very interesting and somewhat traumatic experience for really everyone involved. I firmly believe that hatred or discrimination anywhere shouldn‚Äôt be tolerated, and I think there is a way to do that while also acknowledging and giving space for black and poc experiences.

The area used to have 210 officers, but is down to a historic low of 128 and is struggling to hire more due to a lack of funding and because officers do not want to work in an area where the community limits their ability to do their job. For example, the City Council will not allow the UPD to use ALPR technology to notify the police when a wanted vehicle enters the area. There are other examples of limitations. So, unfortunately, the reality is that this is a far more complex problem that will require the city's leadership/community, the university, and the Berkeley police to support one another.\\n\\nAs for increased security, one thing the students can do is start a change.org petition as a start. It would be impactful if you get critical mass at the student level. The school's admin and Berekely city community need to hear from the students. Or start a letter-writing campaign to the Chancellor and/or city mayor.\\n\\nFlaming one another on social media with holier-than-thou attitudes isn't super helpful. Another thing the student community can do at a low level is advocate for the University's housing project at People's Park to move forward. Are you aware that once completed, the project would provide 100 units of permanent supportive housing for formerly unhoused and low-income community members? There will also be a daily meal service offered by a local nonprofit, access to healthcare, and transportation support.\\n\\nMany in the community are so entrenched in the notion that everyone needs to co-exist with the unhoused or mentally unstable with empathy that we're enabling the current conditions to be the status quo. Some of the recent incidents, like dorm intruders, assaults, battery, etc., have been associated with mental illness and drug use, so ideally, we can address the root cause with supportive services. As the university has said, we can do better for the city's unhoused by offering real shelter, services, and sustenance vs. a tent surrounded by piles of wood chips. The People's Park tends to house between 30-60 people. The project would house 100 with supportive services in addition to reestablishing green space and much-needed housing for students.\",\n",

       "   \"The key word is 'public' university.  Berkeley has its roots in socialism my man.  In its very nature, it is anti 'safe walking at night' because that would involve blocking people from having access to the campus which is non-socialist in principle. \\n\\nThe ironic thing is that in general public schools wind up attracting lots of fiscally conservative people because they are marketed as lower cost alternatives.  Which is only true if your family income is too high to qualify for aid at a private school, in which case you probably deserve to fund a lower income student's education by paying more tuition anyway. But the thing is Berkeley and other UCs probably attract a lot of students whose families' disagree with that line of reasoning and just want to pay less money period. It's ironic.\\n\\nEspecially because public schools take tax-money for the same purposes anyway, but the catch is I guess high income families benefit from their own high taxes via in-state tuition prices being discounted for everyone (including them) in the first place.  In principle, progressive tax rates are supposed to prevent this sort of scenario from being possible, which is again ironic.  As a result I personally noticed the UC system being actually kind of conservative.\\n\\nPrivate schools are usually founded by conservatives, but then over time become overrun by liberals.  Whereas for public schools, the opposite takes place.\",\n",

Hope the family finds strength from this tragedy.  For the other people that were hospitalized may their recovery be a swift one.  \\n\\nSome of the posts I read on this thread are terrible assumptions.  What we know is that the shooting happened due to a fight.  At least that's how the news reported it.  Whether that's the truth we don't know either.  Police are not too reliable but that's a different issue.\\n\\nLet us backtrack before all this talk of criminals roaming the streets or homeless and crazy people yelling.  How about the assumption that blocking the Sather gate makes a person a dumbass or that there are dumbasses for blocking the gate which in turn provoked the events of last week.  That was implied, wasn't it?   \\n\\nPosts on this thread reak of privilege and lack of life experiences.  There are a lot of misinformed people out there and the ugly truth is most of you are students at Cal.  When I refer to a lack of experience.  I'm saying that anyone who's had to grow up in a community where shootings like this happen all the time.  Would not be ranting and raving about how the streets are unsafe and blaming homeless people or saying criminals everywhere!\\n\\nThere are many people and students included that had traumatic experiences like this happen all their lives.  Anyone with sense knows that guns are expensive. So how much do you think it costs to buy an illegal gun?  Better yet who has access to legal firearms?  \\n\\nFor reals a person yelling as you walk to campus is threatening or that they make the school and the community unsafe.  Each and everyone should be ashamed of your comments.   \\n\\nThere are many students for whom attending Cal was their opportunity to leave areas similar if not worse to what is now your reality.  How dare you be so inconsiderate of people that been advocating for safe streets all their lives?  Who in eff said that coming to Berkeley was going to be an effing cakewalk.  That type of mentality is the same one that lives in suburbs and leaves their car and door to their home unlocked at night.  In the morning their all shocked that it happened to them.  Or the people who forgot where came from only to be reminded that class and location will not save you from misfortune. \\n\\nAre you familiar with this type of individual that is so disassociated from reality? When they purchased a home in the well-to-do neighborhoods they also bought into the disillusion of public safety.  I think you probably do.  \\n\\nGoing back to lived experience! It speaks volumes of a person when their reference point to a safe environment, is informing how they see the community surrounding the college they attend.  \\n\\nThe most effective solutions come from people who survived communities like this one.   Another thing and its a fact that Berkeley PD is one of the reasons for the militarization of police throughout the world.  Your school was involved with that too. \\n\\nWhen it comes to street life and you get into an altercation things like shootings or stabbings happen.  It's the way of the street I'm assuming you knew that!  If not take it as a lesson learned.  \\n\\nIf y'all were so concerned about safety then you would organize a group of people that will escort drunk people home.  Would build community support so females will not be walking alone late hours of the night.  \\n\\nNah you just want to point the finger like some privileged donkey. Making assumptions based on fear because you aren't comfortable anymore.  \\n\\nI know of a school organization that believes it's safer for them off campus than on.  Also, those students are safer when they are in their study hall.  That no harm will be done to them there.  That is their reality but you are the uncomfortable one cause of some shootings, a fight, and people yelling.\\n\\nThe campus is threatening and so are you thinking too much based on the lies society says of criminals and homeless folks.  You threaten society because you rather other someone than make space to learn about each other.   \\n\\nI've said enough humble yourselves before the reality you've ignored shocks you like last week.\"],\n",

The easiest way to resolve the issues is to split the course into a 2 semester sequence that actually takes the time to teach you how to do proofs and why proofs matter in CS.\\n\\nAlso take out the probability module. I understand that it has bearing on other classes in CS, but... there are dedicated classes that teach you the material properly in the departments that teach these things for a living (stats, math).\\n\\nThat said, I also disagree with OP\\'s take on the \"skewed hiring practices\" - mathematics is mostly about imitating the proofs and solutions of other people until you get it. The pool of people who \"get math\" to the level that it is required in the CS70 curriculum is already small enough - would you rather be imitating someone who \"gets it\" or who \"doesn\\'t get it\"?

The real problem with CS70 is that it's a monstrosity spawned by intra-departmental politics.\\n\\nThey are trying to cram too much material because there are conflicting requirements from the EE and CS sides, but the EE v CS rivalry does not allow them to remove material so that what remains can be taught properly. They are also trying to make it ‚Äúsexy‚Äù by teaching advanced topics like RSA, error-correcting codes, and linear regression.\\n\\nConventionally, math is taught by first providing a bit of motivation for a concept, then the concept is given a rigorous definition, then simple claims are proven, then its properties are explored, and finally some proof of a minor or major theorem is given. The proofs are often chosen to illustrate new mathematical techniques. \\n\\nIn CS70, there's some motivation but concepts are not defined with rigor, there's no time, so simple properties are not explored, not shown and not proven, and we jump directly to some proofs that students are not equipped to understand.  Students are in a constant mathematical haze.\\n\\nFor example, to teach error correcting codes and secret sharing, you must first teach polynomials over finite fields. But CS70 does not even define what a field is, and finite fields are given a single lecture slide and a bit more than single page in the notes. \\n\\nI can give many other examples.\\n\\nThis is supposed to be the first course where students are exposed to proofs and mathematical rigor, but there's simply no time for that and the course fails in its most important mission.\\n\\nThere is no textbook. The reason is simple, no one else is crazy enough to cram all this material into a single course. The notes are no substitute. They are a mess.\\n\\nThe massive use of UGSI is a big problem. They are very smart and motivated, but they often don‚Äôt have the mathematical maturity or perspective to teach this kind of course, especially the second year ones.\\n\\nAnd finally, if the department wants to require the student to work for the equivalent of an 8 unit course, it should be honest and list CS70 as an 8 unit course, not force students to give up other courses and any resemblance of social life. University regulations are there for a reason, y'all should file official complaints against the department.\\n\\nOn the positive side, at least it is not as bad as EE16B.\",\n",

As a straight-A student (except for my B+ in Math 54), I have never felt more dumb and lost.

Another person in the comments were using the example of finite fields‚ÄîI still don't know what they are‚Äîto say how fundamental concepts were not introduced that were built upon for the actual material in this class. I went to Professor Rao's office hours and it was the most condescending and unhelpful staff interaction I have had in Berkeley; I went to him with a list of conceptual, basic questions to ask but he didn't bother to listen to what I was confused about and started going on long tangents and told me I had to read the notes (and started reading the notes with me).

       "   \"I come from a rigorous math/cs background and also have friends with a similar background and I have to agree with the vast majority of what you said. Prior experience makes 70 along with a whole plethora of classes significantly easier. I also agree with the premise that there are many things the course staff could do significantly better about the presentation of the material. Certainly there are going to be discrepancies no matter how good the teaching is, but it should be the goal of the course staff to bring everyone up.\\n\\nI do think however that it is a bit of a stretch to say that the course staff is making content artificially harder. I don't think neither the professors or the TAs have such malicious designs, and the course policy instead stems from a difference in teaching philosophy. I want to preface by saying that I feel their teaching philosophy is not necessarily wrong, but it does mean there are some significant consequences.\\n\\nFirst, for context, I want to elaborate exactly why previous experience helps. While there is some effect of learning the same content before, that's not all of it. I have a comp math background, but I didn't know about a significant amount of course material (70%). The 30% I knew is a good chunk, but I think an even bigger factor is the level of mathematical maturity that comes from that previous experience. Making intuitive leap of faiths is a natural extension of that experience, and I think that is exactly what the professors are trying to nurture. I don't completely agree with the policy, but I think skipping a bit of the proof such that you have to fill in the gaps is one way to encourage such growth. It's a pretty common method, especially in math.\\n\\nUltimately, the material itself is only a part of what you are supposed to learn. There's definitely a lot of other things (dealing with notation, intuition, problem-solving persistence) that the course is trying to 'teach' on top of the actual course material that are arguably more important. At the very least, that's the impression I get from prof. Rao's mini-rants during lectures. However, it is empirically extremely difficult to develop these skills, even on a 1-on-1 basis. Imagine how hard it is to do at such a massive scale. For better or for worse, CS 70 as it is today is a compromise -- it accepts that some people may not follow (due to inadequate resources), but I believe it at least attempts to maximize the amount that does and get as much as the core skills out of the class.\\n\\nI will end this part by mentioning that I know people who do not have extensive math backgrounds, but have gained significant mathematical maturity during their time at Berkeley. There's also a lot of privileged people who have tried to get into comp math and couldn't. This is to say that privilege certainly has a part in accruing opportunities before college, but at the same time it isn't perfectly clear cut. I believe most are well aware of this, but I think it's important to say nonetheless. While 70 might feel and legitimately be unfair, it's also the class where all those inequalities come to light out of necessity. I'll go further by saying that it has potential to be the class that closes the gap and level the playing field, so to speak. I certainly think closing that gap is part of why Berkeley exists.\\n\\nGiven these thoughts, I have a slightly different conclusion in diagnosing the problems and a set of solutions that will most likely never happen. The main problem is that 70, as a requirement to declare the major, takes the majority of the responsibility to impart mathematical maturity to CS students. One class is not enough, yet it's important that it is a prereq because many upper div classes will require sufficient mathematical maturity not to mention the course material in this class. In an ideal world, I would split 70 into two classes, 70A, 70B, and an accelerated honors class H70 like in a lot of math classes. First would be geared more towards mathematical understanding, the second towards the more specific parts of 70. Splitting 70 would give the needed time to digest the content and develop necessary skills. Anecdotally, one of the best ways to develop my own math skills was to spend a long time with one problem, but the pacing of 70 currently makes that hard to do, especially if you don't have experience before. An accelerated class would satisfy those who do have experience. With the budget as it is, I don't see this happening any time soon though.\\n\\nOn a side note, many TAs might lack significant teaching experience, and therefore lack certain qualities that you mentioned. I think it's important to realize that some TAs are going to be undergrads not much older and experienced than the students so mistakes (to some extent) are to be expected. Please, give specific feedback so that they have an opportunity to grow. Also, as you've said, a majority of TAs have comp math backgrounds, and a majority of bad experiences for you come from people with majority comp math backgrounds. Do account for base-rate fallacies when generalizing your experiences.\",\n",

       "   'I don‚Äôt know how to do the quote shit but this may be ugly, but a few takeaways \\n‚ÄúIn CS70, the gap is way bigger and they probably have the data to support this claim‚Äù\\nSource?? In fact I would imagine it‚Äôs significantly smaller if we‚Äôre considering everything, because for a substantial amount of students CS61A is their first time ever coding, whereas CS70 is certainly not their first exposure to math. Additionally, many recommend taking courses such as the EECS16 series and Math 53 in order to prepare for CS70. This preparation simply doesn‚Äôt exist for the 61 series as the only courses available are CS 10 and Data C8, which simply do not come near the rigor of the CS61 series.\\n‚ÄúAn overwhelming majority of students will tell you that lecture is useless‚Äù \\nAnd an overwhelming majority of students struggle in CS70. As someone who went to essentially every lecture, I can assure you a large portion of students did not go at all, however the people that I know that did go (granted this is anecdotal), ended up doing well in the course. I would love to see data on this, and of course this is just speculation, but I guarantee there‚Äôs a positive correlation between lecture attendance and grades. \\n\\n‚ÄúI have spent approximately 900 hours‚Äù\\n\\nI‚Äôm sorry but this is just absurd. There just exists diminishing returns in studying and it simply does not make sense to be spending this much time. Not all studying is created equally, and I highly encourage you to reach out to peers that did well and see what their strategy is and adapt your study habits.\\n \\nThis one is two quotes \\n‚ÄúFor students who don‚Äôt have time to spare‚Äù \\n‚ÄúWhy offer a no-homework option‚Äù\\nYou critique CS70 through Tarang with past exams not including enough walkthroughs on the solutions. First off I think I agree with this philosophy of not just handing out the answers to students, and the person that convinced me was Professor Adikhari who designed Prob 140, and is an incredible professor. When you have difficult topics like Discrete Math and Probability Theory, all the learning comes through struggling and developing your own problem solving techniques. Seeing the answer just simply restricts your ability to learn. And I think the no-hw option exists purely for the reason of being accommodating. \\n\\n‚Äú61AB has a plethora of resources‚Äù\\n\\nI have to hard disagree with this. In office hours for CS61B it was extremely common for people to wait for 3 hours absolutely stuck on a bug, only to get 3 minutes with a TA that gave them the completely wrong advice. That simply doesn‚Äôt exist in CS70 where there isn‚Äôt the same existence of getting stuck on a bug, and there is always quick response times in office hours (legit the few times I went I was the only one haha).\\n\\nOverall, I think CS70 is difficult because 1) people do not take the proper prep courses to gain that ‚Äúmathematical maturity‚Äù (cringe term but true) and 2) because you just simply can‚Äôt half ass it like CS61 series where you can just spend a couple days grinding practice exams (61A) or projects (61B/C). Attendance is absolutely abysmal in CS70 and it‚Äôs just not a course you can be not present for and do well.',\n",

By most measures, I've become pretty successful in my career.\\n\\nHere's what worked for me: I just continued to work at it, focus on my own development, looked for good opportunities and try to play to my strengths. I wasn't afraid to take risks. My journey wasn't always an easy one and things weren't always awesome. I had down moments as well as up moments. Sometimes things were stressful and sometimes things were great. \\n\\nWith tech, the market is so hot that having some kind of background will open a door for you. And all you need to do is focus on getting better and not be afraid of a bit of adversity. Many of my peers at my FANG company are from great schools like Berkeley, Stanfurd and Caltech but many are also from school's not known for their CS program or don't have formal CS backgrounds at all. The ones who got on the perfect path seem to stand out but most people who reach success didn't have a straight line up.\",\n",

       "   'OP is giving great advice that I wish I could give to all Berkeley students regardless of major - every one of you got into Berkeley, which is an impressive feat in and of itself.  Recruiters see this and they will be impressed, regardless of major.  \\n\\nI\\'m a grad student in an unrelated discipline, but my spouse and I have a lot of friends here who have successful, rewarding, and high-paying jobs in tech, many of whom did not major in CS or a computer-related discipline at all.  Our most successful, high-paid friend works in computer security and manages a team of engineers.  He majored in business administration in undergrad at a just-fine state school with ok grades.  He loved programming and built up those skills on the side because at the time he didn\\'t know he would want to make it a career and business seemed more lucrative.  When he graduated, he decided to try his hand at programming jobs. He had to hustle a little bit in his first couple of years, but 12 years later, he is extremely successful, loves his job, and is contacted by recruiters all the time.  Another friend majored in ART, but always liked computers/digital stuff and he easily retrained with a few cc/extension courses and landed a really sweet job in front-end development/UX that pays him well and that he loves.\\n\\nMy point here is that many of you have been raised in a culture that is extremely competitive and cutthroat, and you are at BERKELEY, which is a very competitive place. (Many, many schools don\\'t require their undergrads to compete for spots within a major, that is unique to Berkeley.)  If you have passion for something and put in the work to develop skills, you will be able to find a job that you like, even if you didn\\'t major in it.  That goes for non-CS majors as well. Try to identify the skills you\\'re good at across your classes, and the types of professional tasks you like, talk to some of the coaches at the career center about how to write your resume to play up those skills, and then try to get some practical experience for a few years.\\n\\nSome of you will land super elite jobs right out of college, some of you will probably have to do a few years of grunt work (most people, even from ivies have to do this - some people by choice because they were miserable in their first \"elite\" career path and decided to start over), but please don\\'t make your self worth about whether your grades or major are elite enough.

Good on you for your success and for sharing that it's not the end of the world when things don't pan out exactly as you envisioned them.  That's a good general life lesson.  Flexibility and tenacity will take you farther than just brut force.  There are always going to be things that derail your plans that you absolutely can't change or fix.

To do so, our current estimate is that we would need to reduce our targeted fall 2022 new undergraduate student enrollment by at least 3,050 students. That in turn would mean reducing the number of offers of admission by at least 5,100.\\n\\nIn other words, at least 5,100 freshman and transfer students who would otherwise have been offered admission for fall 2022 would not receive such an offer. (In a typical year the campus offers admission to approximately 21,000 freshman and transfer students, and enrolls about 9,500 of them.)\\n\\nToday we filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of California as we feel the order was made in error. You can learn more about the court case and related enrollment concerns in a statement we posted today.\\n\\nWe want to assure you that we are pursuing every possible option for avoiding what would be a dire situation for prospective students and our campus. And, should we not succeed in our efforts to keep the enrollment freeze from being implemented, we will do everything in our power to mitigate the impacts on prospective students, and current members of the campus community. \\n\\nThis is unsettling news, we know. We recognize the amount of heart, energy, and intellect each student pours into their application, and today‚Äôs news is incredibly disappointing. Please continue to consider Berkeley as we challenge the court ruling and continue to fight for everyone one of these thousands of students who worked so hard for, and earned, a seat at UC Berkeley. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nAssociate vice chancellor of enrollment management and dean of undergraduate admissions\\nUniversity of California, Berkeley',\n",

Institutions have been using these tactics in attempts to sway public opinion for a long time. Whenever an institution is subject to protests or strikes they‚Äôll always find a way to cry to the public about how much money the evil protestors/strikers cost them, and because it seems like a lot of money, many people will support them. Institutions know this is a powerful tool so, in a quest to manipulate the public, they tend to place their hands on the scale. They do this in two main ways:\\n\\n1): they intentionally inflate the damages caused- institutions know that it‚Äôs make them look good to paint their opposition as destructive, and they know that more destructive the opposition seems, the better it makes them look. Institutions have a perverse incentive and they act on it by abandoning assets (leaving, probably insured, vehicles and property in the path of the protest and hoping for the worse), misclassifying other costs as damage ( such as labeling security costs, worker salaries, and sometimes lost productively as damages), and exaggerating loses (by representing minor vandalism or damage as the complete destruction of an asset and by neglecting to give net losses, which ,because most of the assets damaged will be insured, will be almost nothing)\\n\\n2): they give a false sense of the monetary implications- Institutions will just state an amount of damage. Some arbitrary huge dollar amount. That‚Äôs because they want you think of how that money relates to you, when in reality we should be thinking of how that amount relates to them, to their profit margin or operating budget. Let‚Äôs for example, assume that the protestors did cause Berkeley to eat a 1.5 million loss. That‚Äôs a lot of money for an individual, but it‚Äôs 0.05% of Berkeley‚Äôs 3 billion dollar operating budget. To put that in perspective, if you made 50k a year 0.05% of that would be $25 dollars.

This promotes the idea that we should just treat every one the same regardless of race. Now at first this seems great, after all, this is a policy that completely ignores race, and therefore any other policy would be inherently racist, right?\\n\\nHere is the problem: Non White people in this country have historically been denied equality, and even after the 1960\\'s when race based legislation generally became illegal, inequality persisted. Let me provide an analogy. Suppose two people are about to run a race. One of them has 40 pounds of weights strapped to their legs while the other doesn\\'t. This race is obviously unfair. Let\\'s say that the race begins and once the unencumbered racer crosses the half way mark, the racer with the weights on their legs is allowed to drop the weights and run freely. Now the race is fair right? Of course it isn\\'t. I suppose at that very moment it might look that way, but the reality is that the racer who carried the weights is at a huge disadvantage because of the weights they had to bear before, even if they are gone now. Simply removing the weights is not enough to make the race fair.\\n\\nAnyways, the point is there is a lot of racialized wealth disparity in this country. [The average Native American household maintains just 8% of the wealth maintained by the average White household.](https://www.bushfoundation.org/racial-wealth-gaps-research-and-data) This is not a gap of a few percentage points, it is an ocean of difference.

No bug salads, but just really bland... The chicken tenders last week tasted restauraunt quality, as if they were freshly made. This week, it tasted like something I'd find from the frozen section in safeway. The quality of the ingredients in general also tastes a bit offputting.

Opens up like twice (ok maybe 1.5x) the floor area for whatever you want. This could be a small couch, two dressers, a console for a TV, what have you. \\n\\nI'd recommend mapping this out on graph paper - get the dimensions of the room, and make each graph paper square 1 square foot in the room. Then trace out where a queen bed would go vs. bunk bed and see how much extra space you get and what could fit in that extra space. \\n\\nAt the end of the day, as everyone is saying, sharing a bed is only weird if either of you think it's weird. And what either of you think is weird is up to no one but yourselves. However, my tip is this: think of the worst night you ever had, where all you wanted was to just be in your bed by yourself without anyone disturbing you. If you share a bed with someone, you'll have to be ready for the possibility of having a night like this with someone sharing the bed with you - and vice-versa.

BTW, shelters for women of domestic violence where men are not allowed entry is quite common.\\n\\nSame goes for those who are Trans who want a space that isn\\'t anti-Trans and a shelter from those who aren\\'t Trans, because as students, they interact with Transphobia practically every day and want to return to their home with a peace of mind and no one who could potentially invade their space with re-traumatizing Transphobia.\\n\\nSo Black people aren\\'t excluded from the need to have protected spaces.

The difference is that those who are making disparaging comments are not Black, not fully aware of the Black experience, and don\\'t acknowledge or respect Black lives, our mental health, and need for protected spaces after experiencing multi generational slavery, exploitation, Jim Crow, systemic marginalization, economic disfranchisement, over-policing and rapid criminalization, fetishization, denial, erasure, Karen\\'s, Proud Boys, armed militias, and this generation\\'s four years of the Trump administration.

If you already had a criminal record with other felonies, you could try to shoot for a conviction under California's Three Strike Law, which might be a ticket to San Quentin.\\n\\nYour best bet might be to attempt armed robbery of a bank. This is unlikely to hurt anyone as bank tellers are trained how to deal with this situation professionally, and you are also unlikely to get away with it, if you are worried about the ethics of taking money from the bank. Also, the bank is insured for this kind of stuff anyway.\\n\\nHowever, one issue is that you risk getting shot, either by a security guard or a civilian who happens to be armed. I don't think this risk is extremely high in a social justice state like California, and it's less likely to happen if you act calm and professional, but it's still a risk.\\n\\nThe other issue is that you might get a long sentence for attempted robbery of a bank. In general, the kind of crimes that get you sent to San Quentin also carry long sentences. However, you might be able to take a plea deal for a shorter sentence, given you are a first-time offender. And you could also claim that it was a lapse of judgment brought on by your failing grades.\\n\\nWould you consider going to a federal prison rather than a state prison? There are a lot more non-violent crimes where the federal government will throw the book at you, than for state crimes.\\n\\nFor instance, computer crimes like hacking often carry very harsh federal criminal penalties. The guy who made the Silk Road, a dark web website for buying drugs, got a life sentence without the possibility of parole. That's harsher punishment than most murderers get, and just for creating a website.

When I was 16 the house we rented/lived in was set on fire by an arsonist, so we had to find another place in Berkeley to live. My mom (and dad, RIP) scoured the city looking for somewhere that had comparable rent, and the majority of places were 1 or 2 bedroom apartments. You know what kept happening though? Landlords wouldn‚Äôt rent out to us because they intentionally set limits to how many people could live in the apartment to 2 people (which meant families would be excluded), in order to rent out to students (and jack up the rent a ridiculous amount). This was especially the case for places that were near campus, which is also close to where I attended high school.

I have made [these points before](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wg5wsm/could_we_get_a_megathread_for_peoples_park/). I mean enjoy a good bit of banter as much as the next guy, but this is an altogether more antagonistic branch of this subreddit than I have ever seen.

Again, people will take your smallest support and run with it. \\n\\nAs for me, I will support you if you just sit by and watch the university create more housing. But I will always fight against those who actively wish the protestors harm. \\n\\nSo mods, please just make a megathread and let those who wish to debate it do so there. As of now, there is little good to be done by having people get up in arms about a non-issue. (Why is it a non-issue?

LOL \\nThe truth of the matter is, women have been discriminated against for centuries ‚Äî CENTURIES. Hell, even the church in the olden days gave men permission to beat their wives bc women aren‚Äôt allowed to be sexual or something (which is a practice that still goes on today ‚Äî really goes to show how imbedded these ideals are in our society). Women were barred from having real jobs, moving up in the social and professional ladder, shunned if they even got divorced, and so on. Hell, even now women can‚Äôt get abortions bc some ppl think they can control our bodies. There are literal laws controlling what we can and cannot do with our bodies. So it makes sense why feminists would fight for what‚Äôs been wrong for centuries first then what has only been brought up in the past decade.\\nFact is, men have always had the leg up in society. \\nAnd before anyone comes for me, I KNOW a lot men also face their own issues and how society also places a lot of pressures and expectations on y‚Äôall. Men have it bad too, but historically, not as bad as women. \\nThat is not that say we shouldn‚Äôt advocate for men‚Äôs ‚Äúrights‚Äù. Like I said, men deserve a fair hearing in divorce/child custody trials. There should be baby changing stations in men‚Äôs bathrooms. There shouldn‚Äôt be a innate fear of men. Men shouldn‚Äôt need to feel like they must conform to society‚Äôs def of masculinity in order to feel/be attractive. Y‚Äôall deserve to live freely and comfortably too.\\nBut you have to ask why do these issues exist? Why and how did they start and why have they been continuing on to this day? The issues that men face were created by men and perpetuated by men and women (from internalized misogyny) from the past. (If you know your history, yes, most of these issues were created by men bc of what they thought was right ‚Äî usually rooted in religion ‚Äî and also women had little to not power so). That is what we call the patriarchy. So instead if men attacking feminists, who all actually do fight and advocate for gender equity/equality and freedom of expression, safety, and comfortable living FOR ALL, let‚Äôs fight the patriarchy together.',\n",

       "   'I can tell you where your money is not going - to your instructors.\\n\\nI am teaching a class with more than 200 students in that class.\\n\\nBy my estimate, the pro-rated pay for all the instructors in that class is (in terms of take-home pay) is about $120k, split VERY unevenly between the professor and the GSIs. Adjust that by about 25% up to account for the total the university has to spend on its staff (taxes, health insurance etc), and you get a nice number of $150k that is being paid by the university just for the teaching staff.\\n\\nNow, I can\\'t tell you EXACTLY which class this is, but if you use the 200 student number, each student is paying the staff $750 for the instruction.\\n\\nNow, if you are taking an average load of 16 units (which all of you should be taking to make the most of Berkeley btw), the average tuition (no fees, just tuition) with 15% non-resident students is around 8k.\\n\\nNow presumably the university gets some money from the government per student. Someone more knowledgeable about this should tell us whether that\\'s the case, but let\\'s roll with $8k as the cost of 16 units. This gives you a nice cost per unit of $2k for a 4 unit class.\\n\\nThis means that for big classes (which every single one of you will take, probably the majority of classes you will take), the university is passing less than 40% of your pro-rated tuition to your instructors. And this is disregarding any allowance that the govt gives for in-state tuition, which probably raises the money that is \"spent\" on tuition.\\n\\nIf you think the math is only broken for big classes, consider a 20 person 4 unit class taught by a post-doc with no GSI (postdocs make $60k a year with benefits). For one semester, that\\'s $30k in cost, or $37.5k with benefits and taxes etc. Divide by 20 and you get... less than $2k, by about 6%. But how many of these 20 person classes are you going to be taking in your time here?\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n1) Big classes subsidize small classes, except they don\\'t because tuition money more than covers the cost of instruction\\n\\n2) Your non-tenure track instructors (including GSIs) get absolutely obliterated by their low pay compared to the opportunity cost.\\n\\n3) And somehow the university still does not have enough money.\\n\\nSo yes, there is some mismanagement problem, but it is not just in the non-academic services that you are granted.',\n",

I was attending my dream school at one of the best private music conservatories and paying like $10,000 a year in student loans and making rent/food was nearly impossible for me. Long story short, I dropped out of school twice but came back the first time. I also got incredibly depressed and started doing poorly in class and didn‚Äôt even show up to some of my final exams because the financial stress/pressure from school was too much. I was SO discouraged with continuing my education because when I ultimately left I had a 2.65 GPA. I fixed it going to City College of San Francisco, which helped me get into Berkeley, but that‚Äôs another story.\\n\\nSometimes it‚Äôs helpful to take some time off and do something different but still productive. Whatever that means TO YOU. One thing that helped me (and I know most people would never think of doing this) is that I joined the Army Reserve. If you need money for school, it‚Äôs one of the best things you can do. Basically the commitment is 6 months to a year (or more depending on if you pick a particularly educationally based job like a linguist or military intelligence) of full time work. After that you do one weekend a month and two weeks full time during the summer. \\n\\nIf you have a lease in the Bay Area, you get a housing allowance for paying your lease. It‚Äôs the median cost of housing in the zip code your lease is in. For San Francisco/Berkeley, you would get $5,000/month on top of your Army salary, which would give you roughly $7,000/month for however long you‚Äôre doing your active duty training.\\n\\nOther incentives I got in my contract were:\\n\\n$50,000 Student Loan Repayment\\n\\n$1,000/month when enrolled in school full time (MGIB-SR + drill pay)\\n\\n$20,000 enlistment bonus\\n\\nThis is what allowed me to go from being totally broke with $20,000 in student loan debt to being able to go to school at Berkeley and live in San Francisco with a pretty decent standard of living. I understand not everybody is eligible to join the military nor is everyone willing to do it, but for me it was the best financial decision I‚Äôve ever made. \\n\\nAlso, since you‚Äôre out of state, you qualify for in state tuition in California if you have separated from active duty within 36 months. So even though I was a South Carolina resident when I got here, I get in state tuition at Berkeley. \\n\\nAnother option is to go active duty for three years and then you get the Post 9/11 GI Bill. You get free college at any public university plus a housing allowance (in SF/Berkeley it‚Äôs $5,000/month).\\n\\nI‚Äôm sorry what you‚Äôre going through, but do whatever you have to do to stay in school.

If a student is homeless or at risk of homelessness, they can qualify for being considered an independent student, rather than dependent. This means your parents get removed from your FAFSA and you become eligible for much more aid. The dependency appeal process takes documentation, and at Berkeley they require three letters of support and support documents. So if you qualify for in state tuition, I recommend going through this process at Berkeley and starting it as soon as you can. If you reach out to the Student Advocacy Office they can help you. If you‚Äôre not an in state student, then even if you‚Äôre an independent student at Berkeley, you‚Äôd still be paying the crazy out of state tuition, so it might be better to transfer to a school in your state where you‚Äôd receive more aid, and finish college there. I went through the dependency appeal process a few months ago, and this past semester I had an efc of 0 and got the majority of my tuition, rent, and bills covered. I would not have been able to attend school otherwise. Whatever college you go to will give you a lot more aid as an independent student, the tough part would be preparing the documentation and letters of supports, but that‚Äôs easier if you have someone official at a homeless shelter you‚Äôre staying at and friends to write a letter on your behalf.

Be honest, calm and if possible some answers, without worrying about how right or perfect. Goal here is to reach your inner strength. Trust me, you have it, maybe you are unaware like most of us have been or are, but you do have it.\\n\\n(4) You can always resume education later from various sources, and avenues will always be open to you. So, plan to return to school when you have a stronger financial base and a stronger sense of self. Now, be brave to say NO to school and yes to the work force. Berkeley has deferment options and such. make an appointment for a campus counselor,do the formalities and start with a clean slate for the future.\\n\\n(5) Since you have posted here, I am sure you have access to information about emergency shelters. If that's too difficult use your savings to rent a bed somewhere cheap for two weeks or so. Food banks are also available for you to use. Many Churches and temples have free food program.\\n\\n(6) While doing above, please try to apply for jobs at various locations. Retail and hospitality industry are hurting for people. Take anything to start, then you can switch. This is most important for you. Try to start a job ASAP. It could also be internship like Electricians Union, etc. Please write down the places and avenues you will try to apply for jobs and apply one by after another and check them off.\\n\\nApply at Trader Joe's, Home Depot, Ace Hardware, Safeway etc. places as well. Be honest during interview and show confidence and interest about earning money. The way I understand, you need to find your physical as well as emotional legs. Working will help with both and will give you a growth that many of your peers won't have.\\n\\nAs soon as you get the job, read during spare time and begin saving money.\\n\\nDo this for at least two years, but keep studying at your own pace while working and if you feel like take some classes part time, so that you will be in touch with the academic environment.\\n\\nKeep distance from depressing thoughts, be alert about discouragement, etc. If depressive thoughts come, accept them, and let them pass through you, rather than fighting them and engaging them. \\n\\nNow, as you can see, a lot of people are trying to help you in their own way. It's your turn to take actions. Start the causes you need, so that you can walk towards the effects you want.\\n\\nPlease, trust in yourself, and it's perfectly fine to seek help. Not a single person in this world lived a single moment without contribution from someone else--often directly, mostly indirectly. Hope you become a strong and capable individual, so that you can help someone else in the future with the lessons you will learn. Off to work then, jump to it.!\",\n",

It will also help you with seeking damages from the driver that hit you since you‚Äôll be able to trace your injury to the accident. \\n\\nYou should contact your insurance company and see if they can help you. At the very least I imagine they‚Äôll point you in the right direction. You can also go to the police department (not 911 - that‚Äôs for emergencies) and file a complaint against the driver. There‚Äôs a police station on MLK downtown near the ymca. \\n\\nGood luck, and next time don‚Äôt hurry to class because taking care of yourself after getting hit by a car is much more important.',\n",

Most of my friends and I do not have any prior comp math experience and we all ended up with decent grades in the SU20 iteration of cs70.

If you have strong a mathematics maturity, such as be accustomed to formal proofs or  rationalizing some science stuffs in the past. It shouldn't be that bad. However, if you didn't, don't worry. Just try your best to read all notes before attending lectures. I could say if you could write out any proof in the notes. You are fine with this kind of abstract thinking.\\n2. Lectures cover material in very abstract ways, but the homework really helps you to get familiar with everything in depths. Personally speaking, I found lectures not quite helpful. It's basically reiteration of the notes, but sometimes oversimplifying the nuances of the beauty of this course. So, my suggestion is to spend more time on homework individually. It's completely a different experience from discussing them with classmates because sometimes on the exam you don't have that many collective ideas.\\n3. Exams in summer are much more friendly than in normal semesters. Just practice and train yourself to speed up. It's somehow different from homework because exams usually emphasize on the range of materials and therefore don't have many sophisticated thinking like homework do. Usually, 1 std + on midterm and final guarantees an A and the averages corresponds to B (or B+, a little bit unsure).\",\n",

       "   'Transcription of Daily Cal article by Professor Nicholas Weaver:\\n\\n>The following is my personal opinion. I do not speak for the EECS department, campus or anyone else.  \\n>  \\n>UC Berkeley\\'s electrical engineering and computer sciences department is trapped in a campus that underfunds undergraduate education but also demands that the department accommodate a huge growth in demand. Ten years ago, the department graduated roughly 400 students with Bachelor\\'s degrees in EECS or computer science. This year, the number will probably be 1400, or roughly 15%, of all undergraduates.  \\n>  \\n>A department that has privately tried to hold things together throughout a decade of unprecedented growth now lacks the funds to teach at scale and has to take unilateral action. Thus, for example, CS 70 (a class needed to declare Letters and Science CS), is almost certainly going to be limited to those who were admitted as intending to do CS starting in fall 2022.  \\n>  \\n>The fundamental problem starts with a campus that deliberately underfunds undergraduate education. The campus provides departments such as EECS with a budget of slightly more than $50 per student-credit per hour to pay for both lecturers and TAs. A student in a 4-unit class contributes roughly $200 out of the student\\'s overall tuition for these expenses. Yet the actual cost to a department is more than $350 per student for that 4-unit class, forcing departments to find additional funds to cover the upward of $150 per student gap.  \\n>  \\n>At this point the EECS department is running an annual deficit of nearly $5 million, and cutting this requires drastically cutting enrollment in CS classes. But the deficit is in many ways an excuse to do what needs to be done as no other major campus teaches at this seemingly impossible scale.  \\n>  \\n>We stumbled our way into handling the demand by scaling class resources using undergraduate TAs. We can maintain a pipeline of students who first take the class; then serve as a reader or tutor; then as a TA for multiple semesters. But this pipeline works only if a class is taught every semester.  \\n>  \\n>This technique has allowed classes, such as CS 161, CS 188, and other to each support more than 1,000 students a year.  \\n>  \\n>If we lose one of these classes for a single semester ‚Äî as might happen soon ‚Äî this disrupts the talent pipeline. Now the class changes from one that can support 1,000 students a year to one that can support perhaps 300 as the undergraduate talent pipeline evaporates. Losing just a single one of these scaled classes will be a disaster since the department must provide more than 7,000 student-seats per year in the upper division courses. It will create a situation where there are simply not enough classroom seats for our existing majors to meet graduation requirements.  \\n>  \\n>Repeatedly teaching the same class in order to maintain the pipeline is a recipe for faculty burnout and, without campus support, a thankless task. Dropping the student population by more than 50% would eliminate the need to maintain the teaching pipeline for so many classes, allowing the department to safely offer many of these classes only once a year rather than every semester.  \\n>  \\n>The department tried to convince Letters and Science to shift to a freshman admission model for CS in order to control the size of the major. Letters and Science rejected it. Thus it is highly likely that CS 70, a class necessary to declare the CS major, will be restricted starting in fall 2022 to only the students who actually listed CS or EECS as their intended major, cutting through the backdoor a major that Letters and Science refuses to allow the department to control earlier in the pipeline.  \\n>  \\n>And if this proposal is somehow circumvented or rejected by Letters and Science, it would be natural to restrict CS 70 to \"declared EECS and Letters and Science students only\" in 2023 ‚Äîand, since a student can\\'t declare in Letters and Science until they take CS 70 first, will kill the Letters and Science major entirely.  \\n>  \\n>The money is no doubt a concern. But even if campus would fund the department\\'s teaching (in the end it would cost less than $5million a year, or half of the stadium debt payments that campus took over from the athletic department), the department is still in danger of shattering just due to demand.  \\n>  \\n>In an ideal world, the EECS department would teach all those at UC Berkeley who want to pursue CS. But that would require explicit campus support ‚Äî not only a substantially higher amount of Temporary Academic Staff funding to eliminate the department\\'s deficit but also a willingness to provide more faculty slots to enable the EECS department to grow with the demand. As a department, our student/faculty ratio is three times worse than comparable institutions.  \\n>  \\n>Without this support, the number of students has to be drastically cut simply to avoid the even worse outcome of an upper division class failing.  \\n>  \\n>*Nicholas Weaver is a soon-to-be former lecturer in computer science at UC Berkeley.*\\n\\nEDIT: Apparently Reddit\\'s \"Fancy Pants Editor\" doesn\\'t work so good, and deleted part of the transcription.',\n",

We need also to be mindful that not everyone is is as fully protected (only 80% of Alameda county residents are fully vaccinated), and in person UC Berkeley students do pose some risk to them.\\n\\nThe second is that if someone tests positive, they need to stay home -- even if it just feels like a head cold.  A large number of simultaneous outages are not the end of the world, but they are having a noticeable effect elsewhere, like hospitals and airlines.

I sympathize with everything you said. The other option that some of us found other than being top graduates is to get into tech. Tech has been good over the past decade. But I think Berkeley on my resume has done very little for me. Tech usually does not care about academic institutions, just coding interviews and former employers.\\n\\nLA isn't that great for tech though. I was fortunate to stay in Bay Area after school and got pulled into the orbit. I also did IEOR, and transitioned slowly into tech from the sysadmin side. Note that IEOR and most engineering majors do not overlap at all with software, except EECS. I did a work study(?) job at Evans as a sys admin over the summer, and my first tech employer said that was what got me in. I shifted over to devops and software over the years.\\n\\nNone of it was planned. I wanted to get into management consulting but I recall it being very competitive and several companies at the career fairs were not even hiring or only accepting 1 out of every 300 candidates or something. It was only fortune that tech got bigger and bigger and the pays as well. That pulled almost everyone into its orbit in the entire region. Most of us did not know this was coming and are just riding the wave.\\n\\nI think political economy would have been harder to get into that orbit, esp. if you moved back to socal soon after Cal.\\n\\nEDIT: I see your other replies, and that you did a data analytics bootcamp, so you're probably somewhat familiar. and I feel you, that it's very tough financially. You have to really sacrifice for it, and not everyone wants to 180 their lifestyle for several months and risk even more financial burden if it doesn't pan out.\\n\\nso you are right, FUCK CAL. I do realize my degree was pretty worthless as well. Most of the lectures were boring AF and I learned way more on my own than listening to the research professors drone on b/c they didn't bother to show any enthusiasm for teaching. And I would have made a lot more money than I did if I just did a boot camp if those existing back then when I graduated. Just leetcode and get a job at Google or FB and I would be far richer. No college needed TBH. 4 years down the drain.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Skimmed through the rest of the thread. I think most people here are obviously still in school otherwise why be here. That means that their sentiment would probably more be focused on hope that their degree at Cal has worth, rather than it being more about the economy or tech. I do agree with those that say that your major might have had a significant factor. Engineering or science would have been better, and CS would have been GOLD.\"],\n",

Willing to be courageous enough to show your true side. You'll be amazed at the response you get. If you don't get that response, then it's ok, you'll vibe with someone else. You may also give in more than you get back, and that is ok too(as long as it doesn't affect your main focus - school).  \\n\\nNow - the easiest way to make friends is to connect with someone based on common likes/hobbies/dislikes/whatever. You have to put yourself out there when you're out in the world. For example, When you go to class - say hi to the person next to you every day. Know their name and ask how they are... put some energy in that. \\n\\nIf you do you HW alone, just ask someone from class and make some time to do HW together and ask questions if you need help. So what if you get turned down... just ask. Maybe instead of them meeting you alone, you'll be invited to a group. Magic happens when you ask. \\n\\nGo to the library, and its smarter to go to the library where you know there are students that are in your classes. This way - its not weird if you approach them to ask a questions, and get an in.  \\n\\nWhat ever it is - try to do it in a genuine way. If you are shy, you dont need to really talk about a lot. Just need to ask a question, listen, and then add something that progresses the conversation, rinse and repeat. \\n\\nIf you're a wallflower - maybe it might be a smarter idea to make a friend is a high energy person, this way when you both hit up groups, he can attract all the talking etc, while you still get to be part of the group and you can open up to other wall flowers or other people.

Ultimately if we want the economy to recover well, it won‚Äôt be because we move to a fully service oriented economy but because our manufacturers and other industries become more competitive.\\n\\nAs athletics and other traditional methods of funding wane, a massive college of ‚Äúdata‚Äù is a good way to grow the school. The college of engineering is too limited by having to provide quality, intensive education in niche fields w/less than 100 people, and L&S is better oriented to offering breadth, such that a college of data could feasibly try to have thousands of students while emphasizing developed online resources and utilizing land around the east bay to reduce the student housing/affordability crisis. Pouring money into a new college and then filling it with 1000s of majors still seems cheaper to me than funding administration in CoE/L&S. \\n\\nAn ABET unaccredited data science major will likely save money in overall administration while not costing jobs at the vast majority of places looking for data analysts or software engineers.\\n\\nUltimately EECS is a great major, but we are wasting a lot of time and money under the funding crisis by trying to compete for professors/classes/research with every other college when we could expand out the principles of data science into a full college with sub-specialities that would satisfy 90% of the students in a CS class right now. That way, EECS could remain at its current size and still have quality classes and opportunities without suffering so much of a funding issue for great, relevant courses on the EE side (though realistically this announcement means some CS upper divs like 168 or 172 will likely be offered less as those professors are asked instead to reach thousand person data and networks classes).\\n\\nHowever my hot take is that there are more students looking for EE intensive curriculum and not getting it than those who are underserved in the cs material that will be cut, just because the 5th year ms, tons of research labs and other opportunities around campus still help those students compete at the highest level internationally.',\n",

The attorney can send a letter via certified mail and your Landlord will have a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue.

If he doesn‚Äôt fix it, you should be able to break your lease. \\n\\nRegarding your deposit: you shouldn‚Äôt normally be liable for anything that is considered normal wear and tear.

Moreover, a major city level one trauma center doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to test each patient for omicron vs other variants; instead, they randomly sample some patients and extrapolate the data in the labs. The guidance the ICU staff recently received from the attending physician was that ‚Äúwe simply don‚Äôt know enough how this is going to play out to take any risks.‚Äù \\n\\n3) Students never really have been the center of concern of any Covid variant in terms of risks to their health, but young people are extremely high risk for exacerbating the spread of the virus and ultimately, more variants. This ultimately translates to more at risk people dying because of a would-be surge of Covid rates if option 2 were selected. \\n\\n4) That said, younger people can still get very sick from the virus. Anecdotally, my partner had a 27 year old patient with no medical history receive a double lung transplant because Covid destroyed his lungs.  Yes, Covid (if unvaccinated) is still much deadlier than the flu. Yes, if you‚Äôre vaccinated, Covid is about as deadly as the flu. Omicron is less deadly than classical covid, but allowing a Cambrian explosion in the number of covid patients is nothing short of reckless. \\n\\n5) You‚Äôre spot on in pointing out that Omicron has more virality and risk of spreading. This doesn‚Äôt mean that healthcare workers are magically immune to the higher infection risk too. Currently, my SO‚Äôs ICU has 20 out of their 29 ICU beds as covid patients, and she had 5 coworkers (physicians and nurses) call out of work this week because they all were infected. Because of that, the nurses and physicians working in the unit had to pick up 4-5 12 hour shifts in one week to cover the lack of staffing due to infected healthcare workers. Not only is this unsustainable, but your suggestion that ‚Äúletting er rip‚Äù will handicap the healthcare system‚Äôs ability to treat people who actually need serious medical care because of covid. \\n\\nWith all due respect, please show some deference to the people who actually have to deal with this virus in a serious way other than professional or academic inconveniences. I‚Äôm tired of death, I‚Äôm tired of having to help my partner get through clinically diagnosed PTSD because of the number of people she‚Äôs seen die, or panic about dying while in an ICU bed because they refused to get vaccinated and now wished they were vaccinated.',\n",

I remember having a Korean best friend in middle school and he ended up in a Korean group, which were full of very nice people that I got along with, but I just didn‚Äôt feel like I belonged. I ended up transferring high schools mainly because of the fact that I was the only Bangladeshi student in a predominantly white school with cliques that usually formed around race.

This includes being interested in and curious of different cultures and their lifestyles. I wish I did that in high school instead of transferring but oh well.

That is, the social system doesn\\'t exist in isolation but is directly shaped and built by the prejudices of the campus itself. Internal discussions within these organizations often have to worry about racial quotas *because* judgment by those outside of Greek life looks down on places deemed too diverse. I can\\'t tell you how many people I see who are actively saying the \"right things\" are often the ones most flattered and seeking validation from the mostly White sororities or fraternities. It\\'s a bit disheartening and it\\'s not helpful when it\\'s treated as an issue peculiar to Greek life. I\\'m thankful I found a fraternity that didn\\'t really emphasize race and allowed itself to be diverse but it\\'d be a lie to say it didn\\'t affect our social perception. \\n\\nFor this last point, I wouldn\\'t say it made me feel isolated so much as made me realize how empty a lot of the rhetoric and sentiments in Berkeley are. People are fine by themselves but in big groups things do get nastier.',\n",

This guy scammed me a bit differently (there are variations in this scam which I assume they change the story accordingly after feeling out the person to have the highest chance of the getting some $ from the victim). So this person gave me fake cologne claiming it was a gift since he couldn't take them back. (He probably try to sell it to other victims) Then goes on telling me about how he needed to cover expense like gas, rental cars, luggage, etc because of some bs about time zone difference in Italy. He promise he would pay me back by midnight. Unfortunately I fell for it. These people will be a fast talker, intimidating,  but also try to get the person's sympathy by being nice about it. I feel the sympathy part is how they get people to hand them money. But it's all a scam and they play this over and over again on different people.\\n\\nGoing forward I will be more careful when it comes to stranger. Also remember that you don't owe anyone anything like your time, an explanation, etc. So if there are strangers trying to get your attention, you can choose to ingore them if you feel suspicious. Or if you want to help them, exercise caution and be in control of the situation. Once they start telling story, generally it's a scam and it's time to go, no need to stick around. No need to feel rude about it. Especially cases like this where they start off with a seemingly simple question, it can escalate into a full blown story really fast. There's a reason they don't start off by asking for money like most common panhandler, because our first reaction is to say no.\",\n",

I would also say that if you want more development, opposing this project might actually be the wiser move, though counterintuitive.  The city currently allows for a limited number of \"tall\" buildings downtown, and the original approved project on that site was supposed to take an allocation for one of the three 180-foot structures allowed.  The developers for the project have taken a creative interpretation of the state\\'s housing density bonus, and applied it to the 180-foot limit approved for the original project.  Approval of this new project, especially with how ugly it is, will galvanize NIMBYs into opposing any further expansion of the downtown area plan.

And do they mean only symptoms with \\\\*recent\\\\* oneset, or does this include anyone exhibiting comparable symptoms prior to the pandemic??

Complex health issues with many seemingly disparate symptoms already tend to be written off as psychosomatic illness even when this is not the case. there is still so little known or understood about COVID, yet there is so much profit motive to resume in-person actives; this is a troubling combination. By all means, resume your in-person activities, but don‚Äôt fucking underestimate how poorly studied and understood chronic illness is, and will continue to be.

However, it's definitely been left to rot and gone downhill for a while now.\\n\\nI was at the 50th anniversary a few years back and met a lot of people who genuinely wanted to keep the spirit of the park alive, and I agree with that, but part of the issue was nobody was willing to police it. The city and university wanted it dead to develop, and the people weren't able to keep crime out on their own.\\n\\nIMO there has to be some kind of monument to the movement, but it was just that, a movement. As the movement died down, the park died with it, and what's been left is a husk of what once was, unable to be enjoyed by most students and community members.\\n\\nThere are still some folks who are hardline against change there, and they're going to take some convincing. Some will never be convinced. But the city/uni will win. It's inevitable at this point: Public opinion is on their side.\\n\\nIt was a beautiful thing while it lasted, but its time is up.\\n\\nThat said, there should definitely be some prominent monument to the free speech and anti-war movement in Berkeley. Berkeley helps to develop some of the best minds in the nation, and those minds should be [reminded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Park_(Berkeley)) of the [historical spirit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNhCSJuZi9A) as well, that they may use their abilities for the betterment of the world. Housing, however, will still be ungodly expensive.\",\n",
       "   'From what I\\'ve heard, the main issue is that pro-park peeps don\\'t agree with the University\\'s \"two birds one stone\" approach of removing peoples park and building housing at the same time.\\n\\nEssentially, protestors believe that there are other places in Berkeley/around campus that housing can be built, and that it need not necessarily be right there. At the same time, they view this construction plan as a mask to cover the school\\'s true desires to remove the homeless population, and student housing is just a convenient excuse. Dissatisfaction with the measures and resources extended to the folks currently living on the park also plays a part.\\n\\nThe power that the university hold to \"evict\" residents is another thing that protestors do not like, and see this as an abuse of power by the school. Basically comes down to how you view the homeless. If this is their home, then the university is forcefully kicking people out against their wishes. If you see the homeless as squatters on University land, then this is right and lawful, and probably overdue.\\n\\nNuanced topic, which is not helped by trolls and jokes and loud virtue signaling by anybody',\n",

I'll give them that. They're guided with a lot of emotion, particularly anger, which has lead to them being destructive. They feel they're being humanitarian, but the only thing they're helping is the cycle of homelessness, leaving the homeless trapped in the same position, and an unclean and dangerous society (littered trash, and mentally unstable/intoxicated homeless people who aren't getting the help they need).\",\n",

With all things, it's rooted in personal gain, either in the form of feel-good theatrics or social justice clout for further leveraging of their positions as defenders of the marginalized.  Objectively, building on people's park provides a mediated solution that attempts to appease every side.  The project features housing for students, low income housing, and space for the park with a memorial to its history.  It sucks that the homeless are getting displaced, but it was a dangerous area that really wasn't safe for them either.\",\n",

The problem is that many of these same people, especially the NIMBYs who are extremely selfish and apathetic to those less fortunate than them, oppose the housing at those areas as well. Most students have become fed up with all the rampant crime, drugs, and unaffordable student housing.

Especially when you\\'re surrounded by competitive, brilliant peers, many of whom have had more opportunities or fewer external stressors. But try not to let this disappointment extend to guilt over this gift.

       "   '\"According to the claim, UC Berkeley has ‚Äúoverenrolled‚Äù its school by up to 30 percent over the last decade without first seeking approvals from its neighbors, which the judge ruled should have happened under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The lawsuit says that the environment ‚Äî their environment? ‚Äî is being ruined by the presence of too many students, who are overcrowding apartments, burdening local emergency services, and creating too much noise and trash. Since the claim was first filed, the university has agreed to pay more for municipal services and released a 15-year long-range plan for ‚Äúresponsible, flexible, and sustainable development‚Äù to address its growing enrollment ‚Äî including 11,700 new beds over the next two decades. But the court ruling puts that vision on hold and, like the enrollment freeze, will require an intervention from the California Supreme Court to overturn it.\\n\\nThe suit was brought by Save Berkeley‚Äôs Neighborhoods, a group of neighbors with a long history of litigation against the university that‚Äôs headed by Berkeley resident Phil Bokovoy, a lawyer who is also closely affiliated with three other homeowners associations. Bokovoy first moved to the city‚Äôs Elmwood neighborhood, a few blocks from campus, to attend graduate school there. But what was apparently once good for him shouldn‚Äôt be an option for students now. **‚ÄúWhen I moved into my house, there were 27,000 students. Now it has 45,000 students. I didn‚Äôt choose to live in a town with 45,000 students,‚Äù** he told NBC Bay Area. Bokovoy says that he wants UC Berkeley to build a new satellite campus in Richmond, five miles away. (The university briefly wanted the same but abandoned the plan.) If not, Berkeley proper will be overwhelmed by students, Bokovoy told Slate last year. **‚ÄúWe‚Äôll end up like Bangkok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur ‚Äî dense Asian cities where there‚Äôs no transportation network.‚Äù** Not only is his view of these cities incredibly outdated ‚Äî Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur have extensive public-transit systems ‚Äî but it also feels like he‚Äôs specifically referencing the demographics of Berkeley‚Äôs student body, which is 40 percent Asian.\\n\\nThe lawsuit is a stark example of how CEQA is used to stop development altogether instead of actually mitigating its negative effects. ‚ÄúCEQA treats population growth as a big problem, whether or not it‚Äôs occurring exactly where it should be occurring from an environmental perspective,‚Äù says Chris Elmendorf, a law professor at the University of California, Davis. Adding more students to a dense urban area is what more California cities like Berkeley should be doing to lower greenhouse-gas emissions and wildfire risks, he says. ‚ÄúIt will probably create more noise in certain neighborhoods, and there may be more beer cans ‚Äî these are college students ‚Äî but so what in the great scheme of things?‚Äù\\n\\n**If Bokovoy was indeed concerned about housing or transportation impacts, his group would be encouraging UC Berkeley to locate more housing near the school, allowing more students (and faculty) to live in closer proximity to their classes. (In fact, his groups have brought lawsuits against those plans, too.)** Dan Zack, an urban planner in Fresno whose daughter had applied to UC Berkeley and received a letter about the potential enrollment cap this week, worries that pushing thousands of students out of Berkeley means more of them will end up in schools in auto-dependent areas. **‚ÄúThis will put an additional financial burden on them because they‚Äôll have to own and operate a car,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd will almost certainly be a net loss for the environment.‚Äù**',\n",

The much improved availability and awareness of properly effective masks like the N95‚Äôs and the KF94‚Äôs appears to alleviate the objective costs of wearing the mask, so my impression of the general consensus around not wearing a mask was that of a subjective cost: namely, being uncomfortable wearing a mask for a long period of time.\\n\\nI‚Äôm not too sure I agree with the trade-off here, since wearing proper masks is still better than not wearing a mask at all, both for the self and others. Please let me know if I‚Äôm missing something else here, but it just seems to me that if everyone wears widely available and effective masks such as the N95s and KF94s, then the objective benefits should still outweigh the subjective costs of discomfort and fear/resentment of the word ‚Äúmandate‚Äù.\\n\\nTo anyone still reading this, I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm against dropping the mandate at the University as it doesn‚Äôt directly affect me, but I‚Äôm just concerned that another variant might pop up somewhere and cause mandates again, which will only create even more anger and resentment. Given the nature of the Internet, a downvote spam won‚Äôt surprise me at all, but I‚Äôm hoping we‚Äôve come past that and can actually discuss this, as I‚Äôd like to hear some more actual perspectives on the situation rather than being hit with ‚Äúshut up oppressed sheep‚Äù.',\n",

Especially among younger college age students where immune systems are much more robust, continuously exposing yourself is how you keep yourself protected in the long run. You want to keep exposing yourself to build up immunity to common viruses. It‚Äôs undisputed that children who were exposed to colds/viruses more often have a much stronger immune system in their later years (the Hygiene Hypothesis also suggests this). Populations achieve herd immunity for hundreds of thousands of viruses by constant exposure. Hiding for years at a time then suddenly exposing yourself can be much more consequential.\\n\\nIt is and always has been courteous to wear a mask or cover your mouth when you cough, especially when you‚Äôre sick, but wearing one to avoid exposure doesn‚Äôt seem to be the safer route, especially after the pandemic ends.',\n",

As an aside, a program like this would add about $12.50/student per semester.   \\nAlternatively, and we strongly recommend this, is working with Seamless Bay Area to address the affordability issue with students and the transit agencies.

They are working with Seamless to find volunteers and raise awareness and put pressure to the agencies to offer these improvements. This year, we will be working with AC Transit through the Class Pass committee to address and prioritize fare integration for 2023 and beyond.   \\nSo long answer, short - we understand the needs for discounted programs but there are a lot more discussions that needs to be met in order for it to be done.   \\nSeamlessbayarea.org  \\nhttps://pt.berkeley.edu/MobilityUpdates  \\nWe suggest you check out these links above and Please reach out should you have additional questions.\"',\n",

       "   '> Hello folks,\\n> \\n> I hope you and all your loved ones are safe and well.\\n> \\n> I‚Äôve received so many emails about the spring enrollment in EE 120 (Signals and Systems) that I feel compelled to write to you en masse.  Even those of you not interested in 120 might have felt the pinch‚Äîin your attempt to register for other courses‚Äîof what I‚Äôm about to describe.\\n> \\n> For the first time in my sixteen years at Berkeley I‚Äôm forced into the heartrending situation of having to curb enrollment in a course that I love‚ÄîEE 120.  In fact, I might even have to reduce the enrollment size down from its current level.\\n> \\n> The TAS budget (the money we get from the campus to fund the hiring of TAs and Readers) seems to have shrunk across the board, to the point where in EE 120 alone I cannot assemble the team I need.  An absolute red line for me‚Äîone that I will not cross‚Äîis overworking my TAs beyond their appointment limits. Aside from the far, far, far greater moral/ethical abomination of overworking members of my staff, it can also trigger legal conflict with the Union.\\n> \\n> Last I checked, in the spring offering of EE 120 I have about 110 students enrolled, and about 40 students on the waiting list.  To be clear, the bottleneck is NOT room capacity.  The classroom assigned to me houses 149 students.  The bottleneck is my anemic TA budget.  I can‚Äôt hire the staff I need to deliver, to that large a class size, the quality I‚Äôm used to providing.\\n> \\n> In the coming days, I‚Äôll try to tinker with the budget and the TA applicant pool in all the permutations that my 7th-grade can think of, to see if I can find a creative solution.  But the prospects of even keeping the current enrollment size‚Äîlet alone expanding it‚Äîremain bleak.\\n> \\n> Some of you can help in the following way.  If you took EE 120 and did well (A or A+), your overall GPA is up there, and you‚Äôre willing to take an 8-hour TA appointment, do let me know right away, and go online and apply for a position, so I can see you in the database. If you got A-, B+, or B in EE 120, but subsequently took EE 123 or EE 126 and received an A or better, I‚Äôm more than happy to talk with you.\\n> \\n> As an undergraduate at Caltech, I went into the final exam of my second term of Signals and Systems holding a solid A. But I bombed the final and landed on a B+. I know stuff like that happens. But subsequent courses provide second and third chances. I made virtually a career of teaching this material. So, talk to me if you have a passion for teaching the subject.\\n> \\n> Those of you already on the waiting list for the course can feel free to stay on it, But, please, don‚Äôt wait at the expense of other opportunities that may come your way.  I don‚Äôt want you to sacrifice the chance at getting into another worthwhile course while you wait for what appears now as an unlikely opening in EE 120.\\n> \\n> I‚Äôm deeply saddened at the mere thought of turning students away from a course with which I have a strong, longstanding sentimental bond. I‚Äôve been teaching EE 120 fairly regularly since spring 2006, and previously its counterpart at MIT‚Äîboith as a graduate student and a visiting faculty member on sabbatical.  I love to teach this subject to as wide an audience as possible.\\n> \\n> I haven‚Äôt seen this level of interest in EE 120 since about 2012.  So, it‚Äôs a shame that I can‚Äôt enjoy the lovely company of those among you who want to go through the Signals-and-Systems journey with me next spring, but are stuck on the waiting list or outside it altogether.\\n> \\n> Please forgive me.\\n> \\n> Babak.\\n\\n---\\n> Hi folks,\\n> \\n> I thank you for your support and understanding.\\n> \\n> To be clear, I did not want to give the impression that I don‚Äôt have a TA budget. My problem is that I have an insufficient budget.\\n> \\n> For example, I have a star candidate who has TA‚Äôed for me before, and is well-versed with the labs of the course. But he happens to be a 5th-Year Master‚Äôs student, and they cost $3K more than a PhD student, for example!!!\\n> \\n> If I want to hire him and a PhD student each at 20 hours a week, I go close to $2K into the red with my budget. So, forget about hiring readers! (See the screenshot below ‚Ä¶ as an exercise, try to notice other anomalies in the cost structure).\\n> \\n> That‚Äôs sort of problem I have.\\n> \\n> To salvage this, I need a number of 8-hour undergrad TAs who can shine.\\n> \\n> As for recording the lectures, in the past I‚Äôve gotten a budget from the Department‚Äîseparate from the TA budget‚Äîto do this. I hope I can get it again. But if all else fails, I‚Äôll look for volunteers who are willing to manage a camera in the classroom.\\n> \\n> Warm regards,\\n> \\n> Babak.',\n",

Just because your body is telling you, you are in danger absolutely does not mean that you are not safe <3 but it is still valid and important information to have. A few things that have helped me:\\n\\n1) I listen to my body and myself. I try my best to honor my discomfort and do things that make me feel safe, just for now, given the context to the world. Sometimes I feel like I can take on the world and that I have a little more bandwidth for discomfort but amidst the pandemic, that has really decreased. It‚Äôs ok to feel uncertain. It will pass. I choose to take the campuses shuttle instead of the city bus sometimes. I bike instead of walk because I feel more secure. And if I get a bad vibe I will leave. \\n\\n2) I direct my attention to the systemic issues which put us in this situation. It can be easy to make ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù or ‚Äúhomeless‚Äù a descriptor when really it is a side-effect of insufficient social policies. I try to see these experience in a greater context and this makes me feel more empowered to be a part of my community, to not see others as ‚Äústrangers‚Äù. This makes me less hyper vigilant. In addition, systemically, these folks are way more at risk institutionally than me. In this sense, I really try to push back against my fear because as a white woman, my actions have a greater impact on their safety than theirs, mine. \\n\\nBut yeah, I truly won‚Äôt do things that I feel uncomfortable with. Sometimes this is limiting but that is ok. Baby steps. None of this changes your experience and people can be very dismissive for those who feel a little vigilant. For me, a combination of honoring my needs and planning ahead - buddy system/ bear walks, biking, staying in very public, well lit areas etc-, critiquing systems and considering how I could be more a part of my communities and make them safer, also helps. I also can highly recommend mindfulness.

I know many of us at Cal wrote about the ways in which we planned/plan to contribute to our communities in our applications for admission, but what are we doing? \\n\\nWe are crossing the street, avoiding homeless encampments, avoiding \"bad areas\" (\"don\\'t go south of Dwight!\"), beating fellow citizens on the head with metal canteens, and imprisoning persons indefinitely for their reactions to these issues, which is all akin to taking a Tylenol when you have a headache as opposed to drinking a glass of water (because the likely cause of your pain is dehydration).

       "   'The way that adjunct faculty are treated by the campus is not fair, which is a campus wide issue, and not something peculiar to the College of Engineering or the College of Letters and Sciences.  Further more, it is a nation-wide issue throughout academia, and that is something I have great sympathy for.  There should be more done to honor the work done by lecturers and to compensate them appropriately, and I would support the campus putting more pressure on the Academic Senate to change its rules on tenure and to amend its expectations to favor people who do more undergraduate education and less research.  \\n\\nComplaints about having to teach the same courses year after year I find I have less of an ear for.  On the contrary, teaching the same course every year allows one to hone techniques, resources, and one\\'s pedagogy to become a better educator and teacher over time.  It also means one does not have to reinvent the wheel every semester or year, which can help.  It has been my experience that forcing educators to switch topics of instruction on a yearly basis has the opposite affect that you describe.  This could be a matter of opinion though, and am open to the idea that we all have different preferences in our work patterns.\\n\\nYour tone is hyperbolic.  \"Catastrophe\" and \"crisis\" are highly emotionally charged claims, ones that do not bear out.  It is natural that caps and limits will have to be placed on courses, that happens all the time across the campus.  There are not unlimited resources to be given to each department for their desires.  You have a history of complaining loudly about campus spending on student life on campus, but you should well know that there is more than one department on the campus and more than one department who\\'s needs need to be met.  More than 1400 students are affected by the activities and and events that take place at Memorial Stadium and thousands more alumni, community members, high schoolers, and visitors from out of state utilize and interact with the campus because of that venue and the myriad of events that take place there, sports being just one of them.\\n\\nAs always, your complaints are misplaced.  The state is where you should lodge your complaints.  It is the state government that has continued to demand that UC enlarge its enrollments at Cal and UCLA especially, even over the lack of housing, faculty, and resources to support them.  It is the state government that continues to underfund education (both K-12 and higher education) and expects miracles to be performed on a shoestring budget.  It is the state that stopped the campus from staying the gargantuan size it already is, and passed a law overriding a court ruling which would have capped the growth of the campus.  In the past decade the campus has grown by 10,000 students as higher demand from parents and students comes for more college degrees.  With the Baby Boom generation, UC expanded from a northern and southern campus to opening six more across the state.  In the past 50 years, despite larger and larger numbers of students entering college, only one new campus has been opened, and it is far smaller than its 8 other sisters (Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, and Riverside could all do with expansion as well).  Such issues need to be handled at the state level and the UC system level if things are to be properly addressed.  Cal cannot continue to grow, but that is the expectation that both Sacramento and Oakland have placed upon it.  The campus administration can only do what it can when given that box to work within, and its choices are limited.',\n",

They establish a block-deep buffer zone around campus, keeping out anyone who doesn\\'t pass as a student or resident - homeless people and anyone over the age of 30 who hasn\\'t showered in a while are harassed out of the area. \\n- Berkeley residents are angered that UC\\'s policies have forced all the poor, homeless, and criminals out of the campus area and onto their streets. They organize against the University. \\n- Option 1: The University bends to the pressure from Berkeley residents and goes back to the status quo. Campus goes back to how it is today. \\n- Option 2: UCPD and BPD collaborate and push the poor, homeless, and criminals farther out to Oakland and Richmond. Crime and poverty become extremely concentrated in these areas. \\n- With such high concentrations of crime in these areas, crime either spills over back into Berkeley and the whole cycle restarts, or the police in Oakland/Richmond over-police their citizens, culminating in a police shooting that sets off 2020-esque protests. Police throughout the Bay Area loosen their grip in response to public pressure and crime returns to Berkeley again. The cycle repeats itself. \\n\\nMoral of the story: Police don\\'t get rid of crime. They just push it somewhere else. \\n\\nIf you want to get rid of crime, you have to remove the conditions that create it in the first place. In the Bay Area, that condition is high cost of living and low housing supply, and it\\'s perpetuated by the residents of wealthy areas like Berkeley who keep obstructing new housing and then expect the police to clean up the mess when they find more poverty, homelessness, and crime spillover onto their doorsteps. \\n\\nThis whole thing starts and ends with housing. \\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re going to organize against the University, you can demand short-term safety measures, sure.

       "  ['Berkeley‚Äôs claim to fame is its research. Lots of professors with stellar accolades. For some professors, they are here to focus on their research and teaching is a necessary evil for them.  Lots of professors got hired for their amazing research skills, not their teaching skills. That being said, the research opportunities here are great.  With a more optimistic view,  I‚Äôve found that large unorganized classes are an excellent way to learn how to teach yourself and find online teaching resources.',\n",
       "   \"I've already graduated in 2016 but I can talk about my experience. I've seen 3 different universities now and I can tell you the ups and downs of Berkeley compared to other options.\\n\\nFirst is, as others are saying, University ranking don't really weigh teaching. It's research and grant money. \\n\\nWith that said, I can say there is an advantage in terms of education at Berkeley if you play the game right. I'll provide some examples. I can't speak for all majors but I studied math, physics and CS. I attended another public university that is quite well rated (but below Berkeley) and another university in Germany. Compared to Berkeley, I felt my education at both were noticeably worse. This came down to two factors. At Berkeley, the average level of the applicant was higher, so even if the level of teaching was about the same the expectations from the students was higher. The professors could ask for more and we were expected to rise to that. I took similar classes at every university and in many cases the grad classes I took elsewhere felt easier than the undergraduate ones at Berkeley and I felt I was better prepared compared to my contemporaries. \\n\\nI helped teach some classes and I can say the undergraduate education was worse at the other two universities. It felt like the professors couldn't expect more from the students because every time they did there would be waves of complaints about the difficulty of the classes. \\n\\nIt's true simply picking the top students and expecting more from them doesn't mean you're teaching better. Don't get me wrong, I had my fair share of bad professors at Berkeley. But there was another advantage Berkeley had. Since the other universities I attended were smaller departments there was far fewer options in terms of what you could take and with whom. At Berkeley you could min-max easier by planning your schedule around the best teachers for the classes you have left to take. I spent hours reading about classes and professors to find the great ones when they were offered. And those educational experiences were the best I had by far.\\n\\nBerkeley is like every other university in some ways. There will always be good and back professors. Sometimes you can't avoid the bad ones. But my experience with other universities was the average was still worse. A bunch of things I complained about at Berkeley were actually much worse at these smaller departments. Classes and labs weren't as well flushed out and protocols were more confusing and poorly written. Students could get by with doing less so most of them did. There were still good and bad teachers but the worst instructor I had wasn't at Berkeley (but Berkeley was a close second). The grass is always greener. You might be surprised to see that many simple things, even simple stuff like what my graduation requirements are weren't very well communicated and resulted in confusion and delayed my graduation. I never thought I'd find myself wishing I had to deal with the Berkeley administration instead but life has a way of surprising you. \\n\\nThere is one other thing that Berkeley does well and that's research opportunities. The entire reason these universities are ranked so highly is their research. I got to work on antimatter and I currently work at an experimental fusion reactor. I can say many of my best experiences at Berkeley were the research opportunities I was afforded. It opened doors to me and literally changed my direction in life. I didn't stay in the field of physics but I can say I got to experience some amazing things and I owe much of that to the choices I made while at Berkeley. \\n\\nThe education at Berkeley is like most universities, to some extent it's what you make of it. Learn how to get the best advantages Berkeley has to offer because the biggest advantages of Berkeley aren't available to most universities. Wherever you go you'll find good and bad professors. Berkeley is large and diverse enough to have some amazing professors. Find the lectures that will stick with you your entire life. Find the research opportunities that will change your perspectives.\\n\\nI complained about Berkeley as well. When you are stuck with a shit professor it really is a struggle. But speaking from experience, it can be, and frequently Is, as bad or worse at other universities. No education will be perfectly tailored to you. But there are opportunities at Berkeley that still exist. Everyone is competing to have them so you have to go above and beyond to get them. But if you can you'll have experiences that you'll carry with you and opportunities that could change your life.\",\n",

Even if he thinks being trans is not valid, (which he can believe whatever he wants in his personal life bc this is America) it is the case that he is a *federal legislator* so needs to make federal law that is compatible with and able to be superimposed on state/local legal systems. Many states allow and have a *legal* process for changing your name and your legal gender. To say that legal men or legal non-binary people don‚Äôt seek abortions in America, is factually incorrect...so any law he writes that supposes this inaccuracy will be problematic to interpret for states/localities. \\n\\nExample: if a bunch of republican legislators make a law that says ‚Äúwomen who get illegal abortions are subject to X penalty‚Äù and then a *legal* non-woman (like a trans man) who got pregnant gets an abortion...it‚Äôs not clear how that law works given that scenario.

We‚Äôve lived in the same place all my life, so this neighborhood means a lot to me. It‚Äôs also already changed so much, with most of the surrounding houses selling for 1-2 million dollars in recent years. The demographics have also changed immensely, which also means the feel of the area has changed. \\n\\nSince we‚Äôre renters though, we don‚Äôt really have any sense of concern about a ‚Äúloss‚Äù in housing investment. But it will definitely be a shift that will take some adjustment to, particularly going from living in a neighborhood with primarily 2 story buildings, to a huge 12 story building in the middle of smaller ones (without a mix of other similarly tall buildings to even out the ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù appearance). I just hope whatever they build isn‚Äôt an ugly ass building (pardon my language there, but a lot of newer housing just looks straight up boring). More importantly, I hope that a big portion of apartments are set aside for low-income folks. Like if I, a lifelong resident of Berkeley whose income is around the poverty line, can‚Äôt afford to rent an apartment in the new building, then it‚Äôs problematic and won‚Äôt be doing anything to help with the already huge displacement of longtime low-income residents (esp. in south Berkeley which has historically been home to a lot of Black residents). \\n\\nThat‚Äôs just my two cents. It‚Äôll be a weird change, and people struggle with change, but if it‚Äôs done right then hopefully it will have a positive impact for both longtime residents near the stations, and new residents (as well as the environment). I‚Äôm not gonna lie and say I won‚Äôt miss seeing the clear horizon/sky outside my window/when I step out onto my street.

The reason NIMBY's exist is because they are going to lose value in their biggest investment, so if the city is going to do this, they should at least help out the home owners close by that will be affected.

It didn‚Äôt work though. \\n\\nOne night she texted me and told me she was going to do it that night and she was calling me to say goodbye. I tried to stop her through the phone. Then I told my parents and I regretted not doing something about it sooner. I called her parents to let them know before it was over. \\n\\nBy the time they found her she had already overdosed. But luckily they found her in time to save her. I‚Äôm grateful everyday that she is still here. She was furious with me for telling her parents. \\n\\nThis was years ago and we‚Äôre still friends to this day. She was put in a psychiatric ward for a few days and afterwards went to therapy regularly. She still does. After a while she came around and forgave me. Things got much better for her. She is now in a much better place. \\n\\nShe told me a while ago that she‚Äôs glad her suicide attempt failed. If she died that night then she would have missed out on so many things. She has a good job that she likes, she is in a loving relationship with a boyfriend who adores her. She is now an aunt and she is happy. \\n\\nSuicide doesn‚Äôt fix anything. It just ends the pain and passes it on to your loved ones. I know sometimes it feels like the only option. But recovery is possible, it just takes some hard work. Please don‚Äôt let your friend do this. You will regret it for the rest of your life.',\n",
       "   'In my freshman year of high school, I attempted suicide and ended up in the psychiatric ward. My parents were really ashamed and angry with me and how expensive the treatment and ambulance was, so I went the next four years without therapy and being unable to talk about my feelings. I know how it feels to see suicide as the only solution. I know how disgusting everyday feels and how hard it is to even exist.\\n \\nI know how it feels to be mistreated by mental healthcare providers. I called the suicide hotline shortly before my attempt and the person on the other line talked about themselves and their great life for 30 minutes. The policemen who transported me to the hospital made me feel embarrassed of myself, asking me why I would do such a thing when I had such nice parents and lived in a nice apartment.\\n\\nThroughout high school, there wasn‚Äôt a single day where I wouldn‚Äôt go to sleep wishing I wouldn‚Äôt wake up. I self-harmed and made multiple plans to kill myself before the school year ended. I did research everyday on painless methods and why I should try to even live when suicide is an option.\\n\\nHowever, even though I never got professional help, I have since recovered from my suicidal thoughts and I no longer struggle with depression. For me, that‚Äôs from the big change of entering university and focusing on more than just my grades, which was the catalyst. I truly believe that life gets better, especially if you move to a new location/area and get a new start and find new interests. Of course, for everyone recovery looks different, but I think the most important thing to do is stop searching for a reason to live. You‚Äôre already alive. Live life how you want to.\\n\\nI would tell my self everyday ‚Äújust one more day.‚Äù And I would go just one day longer, and before I knew it, the deadline of my planned suicide had passed and I was already in college and a lot happier than where I was four years ago. \\n\\nI don‚Äôt know what this suicidal individual has been through, but I truly, truly believe that life gets better. \\n\\nBut if they are set on this, I ask that the individual does not commit suicide in a public place if possible. It could become traumatic for those who witness it, or become a spectacle online. There are many more safer, peaceful/painless ways to end one‚Äôs life.\\n\\nI really wish the best for your friend, and hope that they don‚Äôt end their life this semester.',\n",

I\\'m doing everything I can to manage it with meds and therapy, but yeah, that\\'s just how it is. I thoroughly know and have lived the feeling that nothing is ever going to get better, and that even if it can, it\\'s only *relatively* better and still sucks quite a bit.\\n\\nUltimately, as a stranger there really isn\\'t much I can do to change your mind. But the post said you might be reading these comments, so I wanted to reach out as someone who has been and may well again be in your situation.\\n\\nOne of the things that helps me get out of ideating is the stories of people who regretted it after attempting it, but specifically one quote that goes like \"I thought I didn\\'t want to live. I just didn\\'t want to live like *this*.\" \\n\\nI don\\'t know. Given everything about existence nowadays it\\'s incredibly hard to escape the circumstances of your life, but, like, it\\'s still possible to some degree or another. Especially if you stop thinking about the future and just do things that are beneficial right now. Like dropping a bunch of your classes and getting on reduced course load to relieve academic pressure, or spending some money you should be saving on some nice things for yourself instead of living off the bare minimum, or straight up quitting your torturous job or outright changing your major to something you actually are interested in even if your parents will be pissed (if they care more about your degree than your wellbeing, fuck them).\\n\\nThat might seem horrible and disastrous because oh god what will I do in the future when all that crashes back down on me, but, I mean, the other option you\\'re considering eliminates a future altogether. At least this way you\\'ll be alive. And yeah, of course there will be ramifications, but they can be dealt with, and I\\'m sure you\\'ll be more equipped to deal with them if you get out of a period of your life where you\\'re suicidal.\\n\\nI also know how hypocritical it is for someone like me to be telling you not to attempt suicide. But I\\'ve been on both sides of this interaction, and I *know* that one of the biggest things you\\'re probably feeling is that you\\'re alone. No matter how many loved ones you have, how many close friends you can confide in and family members who love you endlessly, none of them have been in your head and your heart and felt all the complex pain you have felt and could never put into words. Because no words do it justice, they don\\'t convey the complete chaos and grief and guilt that you have lived with, have smiled through, have tried to live a normal life through.\\n\\nTwo things:\\n\\n1.) There\\'s no such thing as a normal life, and by god I\\'m gonna prove it as a neurodivergent genderqueer bipoc socialist, vegetarian, and perpetually-broke performer. Your life matters, just like anyone else\\'s.\\n\\n2.) You and your individual struggles are *unique*. You are not alone.\\n\\nIf countless people like me can experience being suicidal but also implore each other not to kill themselves, maybe there\\'s a beauty in the fact that we need each other. Maybe we can\\'t fully understand what\\'s going on, but we can give you a hug and listen as you have a breakdown. \\n\\nPlease don\\'t kill yourself. I can\\'t promise that things will get better. I can\\'t logically give a totally conclusive argument as to why you shouldn\\'t commit. It\\'s not really up to logic. It\\'s about how you feel. It\\'s about hope.\\n\\nI hope this helps you.',\n",

I‚Äôm DSP and I‚Äôve been here for 4 years now and I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with the absurd lack of funding and resources at the department‚Äôs disposal. My first semester it took me over 12 weeks to get initially listed into the program, despite clear documentation, so I missed an entire semesters worth of possible accommodations. Last year my reduced course load request was denied simply because I had no DSP specialist since my previous specialist was promoted to a new role but the office never notified any of her students.  I was not given a new specialist for over 9 months.  My current DSP specialist, while nice, is frequently unavailable or too busy to get back to me in a reasonable amount of time, creating huge amounts of stress in urgent situations like the one I had this week.  I did not get a DSP proctoring time scheduled for a final exam I took just yesterday until literally less than 24 hours before because of a technical issue on the DSP proctoring website that took the office weeks to resolve because of severe understaffing.  If this specific situation was left unresolved for even a few more hours, I certainly would have failed my final exam without the extra time accommodation.  Most frustratingly, even though some professors are accommodating, I have straight up failed multiple classes at Cal from Professors being unwilling to meet to discuss accommodations (ex. not responding to emails, deflecting the issue by telling me to speak to the GSI-who then tells me to speak to the professor, not being available during their official office hours, etc) and just flat out refusing accommodations.  The DSP office seems to have no enforcement mechanism to hold professors who refuse to grant accommodations accountable and it‚Äôs made my time here unnecessarily difficult.  God forbid you‚Äôre like me and need financial aid to survive, as there are all sorts of weird hoops to jump through to get enough financial aid while on reduced course load, and maintaining good standing with SAP requirements make those hoops even harder to navigate.

She walks the rest of the way, determined to get her master‚Äôs degree in social welfare. Several hours later she reverses course, gets home around 6 p.m. and hits the books.\\n\\n‚ÄúMy goodness, I‚Äôm used to doing a little bit of traveling, but when I saw the commute to UC Berkeley, I almost had a heart attack,‚Äù said the 69-year-old Means, who doesn‚Äôt like driving in traffic and heard enough about Berkeley‚Äôs high rents to not bother looking for a place there.\\n\\nThat sentiment explains why so many students choose to attend Cal despite enduring horrendous commutes or living in crammed quarters because there isn‚Äôt enough campus housing.\\n\\nAbout 82% of the more than 45,000 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled last fall were left to find off-campus housing ‚Äì the highest percentage among the entire University of California system. The university had almost 10,000 more students enrolled than it projected in 2005.\\n\\nThe steady enrollment growth coupled with a severe lack of housing prompted a group of city residents called Save Berkeley‚Äôs Neighborhoods to sue the university over its expansion plan for the Goldman School of Public Policy on Hearst Avenue.\\n\\nLast summer, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Brad Seligman ruled that student enrollment should be frozen at 42,347 ‚Äì the same level as the 2020-21 academic year. The judge agreed with the plaintiffs that UC Berkeley violated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) by failing to account for traffic, noise and other impacts the expansion could bring to the off-campus community.',\n",
       "   'Text part 3:\\n\\nKevin Sabo, 30, knows how hard it is to find a room to rent in Berkeley. While serving as president of the University of California Student Association between 2013 and 2016, he stayed in a dilapidated house with 30 roommates, couch-surfed, slept in his 2007 Hyundai Elantra and eventually dropped out because of the housing struggle.\\n\\n‚ÄúDespite being homeless, I would pack up into the car I was living in, drive down to Oakland and have lunches ‚Äì Chinese food every single time ‚Äì with (former UC President) Janet Napolitano in the beautiful University of California Office of The President headquarters,‚Äù Sabo said. ‚ÄúI felt like a peasant who accidentally wandered into the palace and nobody had caught on yet.‚Äù\\n\\nAfter telling UC regents numerous horror stories about students‚Äô housing plight ‚Äì staying in abusive relationships to avoid homelessness, eating out of dumpsters to save money ‚Äì Napolitano announced an initiative to produce 14,000 beds across the 10 UC campuses for students by 2020.\\n\\n‚ÄúI think that was when I knew that I could probably leave Berkeley and leave the UC ‚Äì having done something and left it somewhat better than I inherited it, so maybe there won‚Äôt be someone who has to sleep in a gym like I did,‚Äù Sabo said.\\n\\nThough much better than a gym, Max Bentley lives in one of the ‚Äúmini dorm‚Äù homes that have been blamed by Save Berkeley‚Äôs Neighborhoods for disrupting neighborhood character.\\n\\nThe 24-year-old English major is one of 10 people living in a seven-bedroom, 3,392-square-foot baby blue Prairie Home built in 1916 in Berkeley‚Äôs Elmwood neighborhood ‚Äì the first in the nation zoned for single-family homes.\\n\\nMost other options Bentley had looked at were either too expensive or impractical, though she almost rationalized paying $800 for a room in a house shared by a 40-year-old man and his father.\\n\\nOnce she found her current space listed for $1,100 on Craigslist, she said yes immediately.\\n\\n‚ÄúI found this place, scheduled a video tour and then later that day I took it ‚Äì I just needed a place to stay,‚Äù Bentley said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even know how many roommates we had in here, I thought there were four. I asked myself, ‚ÄòWhat did I just do?‚Äô ‚Äù\\n\\nThe home is by no means a pigsty packed to the brim with mattresses, but Bentley says she can understand why neighbors may resent it. She and her roommates recently acquired a second trash can to handle all 10 people‚Äôs trash.\\n\\n‚ÄúEveryone that I‚Äôve met has struggled with finding housing,‚Äù Bentley said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see how we could even fit more people in the city.‚Äù\\n\\nParie Wood, another student in the home, noted it‚Äôs hard to be herself because personal boundaries constantly push against each other in the tight space. She pays $800 for a 90-square-foot sunroom converted to a bedroom.\\n\\nWhile making do thanks to plants, a kitten and a fresh coat of paint, Wood says it‚Äôs hard living in an environment where everything that happens in her room can be heard by her roommates, from guitar practice to Zoom therapy sessions to visits from dates. She questions anyone who might dismiss UC Berkeley‚Äôs housing crisis as a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù experience for students.\\n\\n‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs this romanticization of the struggle and ‚Äòpaying your dues,‚Äô so you eat your Ramen, barely make rent and you just barely scrape by,‚Äù Wood said. ‚ÄúI think that there‚Äôs a way in which people sort of either remember that fondly or expect that living with a bunch of people and in a place that‚Äôs kind of grimy is a part of the experience of being this age.‚Äù',\n",

It is infinitely worse to know how many students deal with homelessness, food scarcity, and commutes.',\n",
       "   'Text part 2\\n\\nWhen the university‚Äôs appeal went nowhere, the state Legislature moved with uncharacteristic speed in fashioning and approving emergency legislation that was signed Monday by Gov. Gavin Newsom to lift the enrollment freeze by modifying CEQA.\\n\\nBut that didn‚Äôt erase the housing shortage for students, many of whom commute long distances, room with myriad strangers, store belongings in cars while couch surfing or shell out thousands of dollars for tiny ‚Äì and often shared ‚Äì rooms.\\n\\nThose scenarios are what many of the more than 15,000 incoming freshman and 4,500 transfer students will face this fall ‚Äì an experience dubbed by some the ‚ÄúBerkeley Baptism.‚Äù\\n\\nUC Berkeley offered only 6,916 beds in its residential halls and 1,458 beds in apartments last fall, according to university spokesperson Adam Ratliff. The dorms cost residents about $16,300 for the academic year, not counting the mandatory $5,705 meal plan.\\n\\nOff-campus apartments can easily rent for more than $20,000 over 10 months. For example, a 564-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment at The Standard ‚Äî a new complex across the street from campus ‚Äî charges $5,355 a month and is furnished for two renters, though it can fit up to three.\\n\\nRatliff said roughly 4,800 students ‚Äì none of them freshman or first-year transfers ‚Äì were denied on-campus housing after priority went to students who had documented disabilities, qualified as extremely low-income, were involved in university athletics or were scholars whose admission guaranteed a room.\\n\\nAmong those left out was 23-year-old Ali Sapirman, who pays $1,550 a month for a studio in San Jose.\\n\\nBeing immunocompromised, Sapirman struggled to find a safe place to live while pursuing her philosophy degree during the pandemic. She said the lack of affordable options near campus forced her to either continue paying 75% of her income to live with five other roommates or risk exposure on public transit when commuting from the South Bay to campus. She figured the second option was her best.\\n\\nAlex Melendrez, a first-generation Cal student born to immigrant parents, made a similar choice and took BART and AC Transit to classes from San Bruno before graduating in 2015.\\n\\nAfter watching how the 2008 economic recession threatened his family‚Äôs home, the now 29-year-old did everything he could to avoid taking out loans and acquiring debt to afford expensive housing closer to campus. His experience pushed him to try and help more students attend the university and today he‚Äôs an advocate for affordable housing.',\n",

Also, the core root of this issue is that you are comparing yourself to other people, which is okay, but you can't take it so far that your mental health is impacted by it. It's okay to compare yourself to other people and strive to be as smart or as good (or as whatever) as them, but don't push it so hard that you have a mental breakdown.

Frequently, the questions people asked in class showed me that they were operating at a level above where I was. (True in non-STEM classes as well.) To me that was just fine. I didn't need to be the smartest or most knowledgeable person in the room to do really well. You can just control what you control. That comes down to how you allocate your time, your dedication, whom you study with, your approach to the work, and how you allocate your downtime. Yes, a semester can be an endurance test that tests people in different ways. Don't neglect yourself, spend time with cool people, and try to have some fun along the way. There's always ups and downs. But you don't have to suffer over how easy or hard the work is for others. This is your time to learn and develop skills that could last a lifetime. Everybody has their own gifts.\",\n",
       "   'You are in 2 clubs, doing solo research, doing classes, and recruiting. This is a lot of work for anyone. You may think that others are faster/smarter but have you considered that the reason why someone seems smart is because they just spent 2+ hours bashing their head in to get to where you see them now? In other words, they might just have less work than you do, and have gotten to it earlier. \\n\\nGoing to office hours is a GOOD thing. You SHOULD go to office hours. Smart efficient people use office hours to be smarter and more efficient. \\n\\nIf i were you, i‚Äôd find something to drop, and enjoy some free time once in a while. This could mean cutting back on academics, dropping one of the clubs etc. Especially with clubs, you should think critically about whether or not its worth your time. With academics, you should consider whether or not the information is useful for your major track or for your future career interests. \\n\\nWhen you get a job, you cannot CANNOT continue to operate like you are currently. As a student, semesters eventually end and you go on break, drink a lot, etc etc to cope with burnout. Burning out in the workforce means that you might need to take time off, might need to quit, might miss a rent payment, etc. That is why people talk about work life balance so frequently, career progress is a marathon not a sprint (there are a few notable exceptions aka startup culture, which may be just working 24/7. However, even that might be easier than what you are doing now because it‚Äôs probably more focused and less context switching). The first thing you learn when starting a job is how to manage expectations, say no when you need to, and avoid overpromising. I would advise you to start practicing by cutting stuff from your current workload. You can even make it a talking point in your interviews: ‚Äúwhats your greatest weakness‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still learning how to say no to work‚Äù.\\n\\nTldr; everything you described about your academic struggles is pretty normal.

Many enter a major and start strong (off talent and intellect) only to realize that they don't enjoy the actual work or find later classes much harder than the ones before.\\n\\nFor classes and load management, just ask yourself what you want to learn and go for that. You know the class will take you a little more time than it may take others, so be realistic in your expectations. A reasonable schedule with 1-2 classes of interest should allow you a ton of time for other activities you'd like to engage in.\\n\\nLastly, recruiting is really hard if you're just getting started. Luckily it gets way easier:\\n\\n(a) over time as you get jaded af and used to rejection and applying in person + online \\n\\n(b) when you take harder, niche classes that align you with what companies are looking for \\n\\nSo really just take your time and enjoy the process.

Unless you\\'re trying to go for grad school or a research job, a 3.0 vs. 3.5 vs. 4.0 GPA won\\'t make any difference to potential employers. They just want to know you were able to hang with the rigors of academia and do what you were supposed to to perform adequately. After that, what they care about 1000x more is how you carry yourself as a person, things you\\'re passionate about, skills and experience you\\'ve developed, etc. \\n\\nAs much as it\\'s a dog whistle for slacking off in class, the phrase \"C\\'s get degrees\" is actually very true in my experience. The degree is what opens up doors for you, not the grades associated with that degree. Hell, you don\\'t even need to report your GPA on your resume by the time you apply to your second job since all employers really care about at that point is your professional experience.\\n\\nTL;DR \\nNon-failing grades and stellar straight A grades are practically the same thing in the long run.

If you're grading on a curve than it's impossible for them all to be straight A students any longer. Before they were just competing with the students they happened to live around and now they're competing with the people, like themselves, that worked hard to get there. It's a lot more competitive just by virtue of the people your taking classes with.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, many people who come to Berkeley from the top of their HS have lived their lives being the smartest kid in the classroom. Their lives up to this point have been defined by their academic success and their identity is inexorably tied to their intellectual achievement. What happens to someone whose self-worth is so closely tied to their since of academic success when they get to the the big pond and they're no longer the big fish? I talked with a lot of people who lost their since of self worth because they didn't have another way to identify their own value. \\n\\nI don't think top universities do a good job of preparing students for that reality. For a lot of students, that loss of identity can crush them, impact their grades further, and create a spiral of self loathing, all while racking up huge amounts of debt. Anyone would be stressed in that situation. Many students bounce back, even if their grades suffer, but others don't bound back as quickly. \\n\\nI think the best thing that universities and high schools could do is teach students that grades open up opportunities you might not have otherwise but they aren't a measure of a person. That people are much more than their GPA and that a couple years after your first job no one will care anyways. Even if you spent your youth just working to be the best student, you're more than the sum total of your academics. It's good to cultivate aspects of yourself beyond academics and even if you haven't it doesn't mean that you've got nothing to offer, you just need the time to realize what else brings value to your life. \\n\\nThe funny thing is the people at the top of the grade distribution have it rough as well. Some of the students who were struggling the most with self depreciation were sitting at the top of the class. If your self worth is based on your intelligence you'll always struggle because there will always be someone smarter than you, and they will probably have an office down the hall from you. Even while taking grad courses in their 3rd year they dealt with feelings of inadequacy and self loathing for not being smart enough. \\n\\nThe moral of the story, not everyone can be the smartest person in the room. All students should realize they are more than their grades and that an identity that puts intellectual achievement above all else is no different than one that puts monetary achievement above all else, there will always be someone smarter / richer, so value yourself for more than your IQ or GPA because we are multifaceted creatures. Don't look down on people that are struggling and if you see someone that could use some encouragement or a reminder that their university experience is more than their grades or academic success, reach out to them.\",\n",

I was dating a (relatively light skinned) black woman for a number of years, and observed that people would objectify and sort of consider her exotic and act entitled to her company. It seemed irrelevant to them that she was already dating someone. But I've heard what you are describing from very dark skinned friends, especially when I spent a year in the Caribbean. Dark skinned men were considered strong and masculine, but they always wanted a woman lighter than themselves, and it was really frustrating to people who didn't fit that dynamic. Colorism is BS.\\n\\nAll of this is just to say that I hear you, it's real, it's upsetting. People will try and be dismissive of your experience because they don't realize how pervasive colorism is. And specifically the dynamic of either exoticizing or masculinizing WOC based on their skin color... it's exhausting even to see if happening so I can only imagine living it.\\n\\nObviously you deserve to be valued. I have to hope there is a community of people (maybe in Oakland) that will have an easier time seeing you. There are a number of groups and activities for WOC in the bay as well. One thing I've noticed both from being with my ex-girlfriend, and from having a black step mother, is that spending too much time surrounded by white people is really bad for mental health especially if you aren't white... due to microaggressions and unacknowledged racism. In spite of however hard we try to do the work to undo that shit. Since UC Berkeley seems to be largely white and Asian (and made of teenagers who haven't done the work), I suspect spending time off campus will help.\\n\\nGood luck hun.\",\n",

       "   \"It's definitely not in your head and you're absolutely right that lighter skinned Asian women more commonly fit the archetype of who you want to be dating in Berkeley same as with White women. You see this most clearly reflected in Sororities and how their social status is clearly linked to skin tone and importantly, social perceptions of Greek Life don't exist in a vacuum but are based on how our campus as a whole views attractiveness and who is desirable. There are very clear status games that we don't like to acknowledge especially in an era of supposed racial sensitivity but at times it leads people to deny the obvious while covering it up with pretty words.\\n\\nThe best piece of advice I can give you is to try online dating confidently celebrating who you are as a person. Without a doubt your matches will be different than if your skin tone were lighter and you'll have a smaller dating pool but despite this harsh reality it does not mean that there aren't wonderful people out there who will gravitate towards your natural beauty, physical and personality wise. \\n\\nWhat's good about online dating is that it serves as an easy way to filter out the people who obsess over these status games or have a racial preference quickly and inoffensively. From experience, you will find more than enough people who can see the real you and desire you in a way that makes you feel confident and sexy if you make sure to be honest and confident about yourself.\\n\\nI'm medium skinned, Hispanic and noticed my dating pool was definitely different and more limited, especially since people tend to prefer dating within their own race. But I kept at it and found good success nonetheless. There are people out there who really don't care about these things or find darker skin attractive. Personally I never understood people who prefer one skin tone over another. I guess I just find all kinds of people insanely attractive. I hope this validates what you've observed while also giving you some hope that this can be overcome. Try not to focus too much on the shallow people as it is just not healthy for your self-confidence.\\n\\nI urge everyone to assess how they view skin color as impacting their dating choices and to try to be more open-minded about who you date and to be cognizant that these things *are* noticeable and do have an impact on your peers. I'm not saying any one person is responsible for upholding these barriers but just making a small effort to consider dating someone outside your comfort zone can go a long way.\",\n",

I suppose you might get an F, it's possible.  Unless you are at Stanford, where F's are not allowed.  I'll leave the upside math to you.  NNN = lots of A's and B's.

       "   'Thank you for your solidarity. On top of what others have already shared, I have a number of other suggestions/elaborations:\\n\\n1. Disability Access & Compliance -- aka the 504/ADA Compliance Office -- covers non-academic accommodations and ensures that these laws are followed to prevent disability discrimination. Derek Coates, who is Blind himself, is their Program Access Compliance Manager and can probably address this immediately (or connect you with [other staff](https://dac.berkeley.edu/about-us) who can). This may be more for one-off instances, but [their Mobility Accommodation page](https://dac.berkeley.edu/services/mobility-accommodation) allows people to request info on the \"\\\\[e\\\\]asiest, safest and most convenient path of travel\". Your friend should also be able to [get a service dog](https://dac.berkeley.edu/resources/animals-accommodations), though I recognize that may be a longer process than they have time for in their first semester. They also have [other resources on Navigating Berkeley](https://dac.berkeley.edu/navigating-berkeley) and [other disability resources more generally](https://dac.berkeley.edu/resources/students).\\n2. If DSP is not providing required services, the [Student Advocates Office](https://advocate.berkeley.edu/grievance/) has a whole department that is dedicated to addressing those kinds of grievances. They may also cover DAC, but if not there are many disability law offices, including [Disability Rights Advocates](https://dralegal.org/contact-us/) in Berkeley, who may offer pro bono legal services (they have done so in the past).\\n3. Contact the ASUC Disabled Students Commission -- via [email](mailto:disabledstudentscommittee@asuc.org), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DSCBerkeley), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/asucdisabled) \\\\-- which has other disabled undergrads and grad students who work together to spotlight these issues. (And/or join the [DSC mailing listserv](https://groups.google.com/g/DCCatCal/) to reach out to everyone who\\'s a part of that.) For example, they are often connected to leaders in the disability-related offices and can collaborate with ASUC officials to make issues known and get action taken -- one of the former Co-Chairs is now an ASUC Senator, [Carlos V√°zquez](https://www.instagram.com/senatorelect_carloscvazquez/). It\\'s not always effective, but it may be. And your friend will at least be connected with others who have been wronged by the system and are working to address these issues.\\n4. If your friend needs an extra push, encourage her to reach out to the [Daily Cal](https://www.dailycal.org/about). They often cover scandals like this (news stories and self-written op-eds), and I\\'ve found that it often ends up pushing the needle.\\n5. It shouldn\\'t take big tech to address basic issues of accessibility, but there are smartphone apps that use a live stream from your camera for an employee to provide audio directions for navigating campus. One is called [Aira, which offers visual interpreting services](https://aira.io/), and [UCSD even covers it for their Blind students](https://osd.ucsd.edu/resources/aira.html). If Cal won\\'t do anything else and/or as a temporary solution, they should at least cover whatever this service costs.\\n6. [Georgina Kleege](https://english.berkeley.edu/profiles/45) is a rad professor on-campus, and [Ann Wai-Yee Kwong](https://dac.berkeley.edu/cacdap-members) is Cal\\'s [Disability Community Cultural Center Coordinator](https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/10/29/im-a-berkeleyan-staffer-ann-wai-yee-kwong-wants-you-to-thrive/); both are Blind. If either of them has the capacity (it\\'s not necessarily their jobs to do this work, and the semester is starting for them too, but they both care a lot), they would be some of the few people on campus with lived experience and insider suggestions on what to do, whom to reach out to, and how to get action taken.\\n\\nFeel free to connect me and your friend (via DM)! It always pains me to see this shit happening, though it\\'s not surprising for me at this point. But again, thank you for reaching out for support.\\n\\nSources: I co-founded the Commission with other disabled student organizers, wrote op-eds and organized a successful campaign when admin defunded (or \"let funding lapse\") for an important disability program, met and collaborated with lots of comrades and allies who have worked for and within these organizations, minored in Disability Studies, and was generally pretty enmeshed within the disability community at Cal.',\n",

Unfortunately, a consequence of this is that such people are often hesitant to speak up, and as a result you can feel that you\\'re the only one struggling because most of the others in the group who are dealing with the same things you are aren\\'t talking as much.\\n\\nYour performance in 70 and 170 aren\\'t what will determine your future and your career (unless you intend to go into theory research or something). You\\'re young (even if it\\'s hard to feel that in a place where everyone is within the same age range), and just getting here is a sign that you have the grit, intelligence, and determination to excel in something that works for you. Whichever path you take in your school and beyond, I hope you find a path that brings you satisfaction and a welcoming community.\\n\\nI do agree that there probably could be more done with respect to making 70 and 170 a bit less intimidating.\\n\\nThe programming classes are designed in such a way that there are multiple \"on-ramps\" depending on your prior exposure to CS concepts. People who are confident in their abilities and/or have prior exposure to the subject can hop right into 61A, while CS8 and Data 100 give people some more time to get some intuition and familiarity with the ideas before starting the fast-paced (and high-stakes, for people who need to pass a GPA class) classes.\\n\\nHowever, for 70, there\\'s no such universally agreed-on and recommended precursor class; everyone is thrown into the deep end by the second or third week of class, so people like OP end up being put on the same curve as people who have seen 70% of the material before. It\\'s not *impossible* to catch up, but it does require a massive time investment and can often feel overwhelming, especially as an introduction to the major. \\n\\nSo... for people here who have taken 70 and struggled - do you think that there are certain things you would have wished you\\'d seen earlier that would have helped you in the class? My understanding is the undergrad lower-division math classes don\\'t really help with 70, since they teach a different set of skills, so I\\'m wondering if it would be a good idea to create (perhaps informally at first, as a decal, before pitching it as a real class) a \"pre-70\" class as a gentler introduction to some of 70.',\n",

This is a common thing at large R1 universities because they prioritize pumping money into hiring rockstars in research, not teaching. My personal feeling after teaching at Berkeley for 5 years is that Berkeley undergrads get the short end of the stick for the most part. The profs care more about their research than teaching effectively, and the GSIs vary significantly in quality. I also suspect it's why, in my experience, Berkeley undergrads don't develop basic skills like writing quality papers or learning rigorous research methods. The only students I encountered who were good at that were students who were already good at it - it's not prioritized as a skill all college students need, so the papers here were the worst I've ever seen (and I previously taught at a huge R2 school, as well as a few private colleges and high schools). It's unfortunate. I'm very glad to have gone to a tiny school for my undergrad where teaching was a priority.\",\n",

If not, study the sciences at a smaller school.  It does not matter where you studied the sciences.',\n",
       "   \"In my experience, shit lecturers are a constant at all schools. Every department has the stock character of the tenured professor who literally wrote the book on the topic they teach, but is wholly incompetent at teaching it. Since they're tenured though, no amount of scathing course evaluations will do anything to move those professors out of the lecture halls. \\n\\nThis is a direct result of how the system of academic hierarchy is designed. The folks at the bottom who are just starting out need to perform well to gain a reputation as good educators and keep their jobs. The folks at the top get tenured, so they become untouchable and have no accountability to anyone, so they can give awful lectures with zero consequences to their careers. \\n\\nIn addition to that, there is no requirement for college professors to attain any minimum standard of effectiveness as an educator, since their main roles are in research (it's what keeps the money coming to the university). There is also no requirement for professors to have any obligation to the success of the students they teach. Half of your class dropped in the first week because they couldn't learn anything and are now permanently turned off to a field they could have had a lot of success in? Oh well, no skin off the professor's back. Thanks for the tuition money though!\\n\\nThe problem here is that there is such little value placed on the educational outcomes of the students, so awful tenured lecturers can just keep teaching the same shitty class for decades and damage the careers of generations of students while the university sees no urgent need to do anything about it. \\n\\nI think a solution would be to place tenured professors with bad course evaluations in some out-of-the-way position where they can't have a huge impact on the trajectory of students' careers, like maybe a traveling conference speaker, some high level/low involvement project management position, or maybe the only classrooms they're allowed to speak in are seminars for grad students. Then the only lecturers left in the classrooms are the ones whose careers actually depend on the quality of their course evaluations, so they'd be incentivized to give good lectures. \\n\\n\\nTL;DR \\nShit lecturers are a problem at every school, because of how the system is designed and the lack of incentives around good educational outcomes. A solution to this problem could be to put tenured professors out to pasture and let younger, more incentivized professors do the teaching.\",\n",

It's your responsibility to learn and if other people are doing it and you aren't, then it reflects on something you are doing wrong and not on how the class is taught.\\n\\nAlso, for saturated majors like CS and any of the premed track majors, they're tough. That's all there is. I think many people go into it, again, expecting their tactics from high school to work in securing them an A, without understanding that there are kids who are actively soaking up knowledge and passionate about learning, rather than simply getting an A.

At the end of the day in college, nobody cares what you study, what you accomplish, how your day goes, how you live. And even in the future, nobody cares what you do for work, how much you make, where you live, what kind of lifestyle you live, etc. Obviously these are hyperboles, but I think the point is made. For instance, imagine all the people right now who have worked blood, sweat, and tears in college to eventually work at Goldman, Google, or become a gastroenterologist sacrificing time, health, and money. They tell some stranger what they do and the stranger is in awe for a few seconds and inquires, but that's about it. Why? BECAUSE IT'S JUST A JOB. Sure it pays well and there could be better exit opps, but you're still devoting your time to get a paycheck. Everyone just moves on.

Hopefully, they go on to do great things. But at the end of the day, they're just hustling to achieve some goal. If that includes updating LinkedIn, so be it. You said comparison is the thief of joy. Absolutely. I also want to add that Happiness = Reality - Expectations. When we're grounded in reality, (not everyone is gonna make a fat paycheck or get into that company or whatever out of college), then we can adjust our expectations (Okay, what are the realistic goals for me in and out of college).\\n\\nAnd it's not just LinkedIn.

It doesn‚Äôt seem like she embezzled funds for herself with the money past receipts which is fine and dandy BUT‚Ä¶\\n\\n2. She recommends using student fees to pay for her friend‚Äôs personal finances. This is in the screenshot from the og post. So really it seems like she ONLY intended to emebezzle money. This makes me wonder if the past monies was given out by sort of cherry-picking *just a question i still have. Even suggesting embezzlement to resolve personal financial problems is behavior that is not ok, especially from a public official. \\n\\n3. This is only a symptom of a larger problem. The fact that people like Ms. Sharp can go around the system and get funds for an event which never happened and for a select few people but not others, is problematic. Yes you can make the argument that Black qts deserve money but what about other underserved students? And people are right to point out that whichever org and members that enabled this behavior are just part of a pattern. There are other orgs that probably do this.\\n\\n4. Why can‚Äôt students just ask questions about their fees? I admit some of the reddit stuff on here is not nice and we shouldn‚Äôt be jumping to conclusions *myself included* but Ms. Sharp‚Äôs supporters seem to just be shutting down any and all questions about her finances. The screenshots do not clear everything up. Students who pay fees at this school have a right to know what‚Äôs going on.\\n\\nImo the only way we‚Äôre going to get any real answers is if admin or the asuc investigate this. If Ms. Sharp did not misuse funds, then that will prove it. \\n\\nTldr: The screenshot seems to suggest Ms. Sharp did not embezzle funds though it doesn‚Äôt answer why she suggested embezzling funds as an answer to her friend‚Äôs personal finances.

There is a vibrancy to campus that I do not believe is simply self-sustaining - it requires constant work to maintain and hopefully improve, and to bring in new students and faculty. More broadly, I personally believe that society as a whole has greatly benefits from the modern American research University -- of which Berkeley plays a substantial role.\\n\\nAnd yes, I feel like we can point to lots of examples in this University that are maddening, inefficient, or seem to just be poor uses of money. Running Berkeley is an approximately $3 *billion* dollar per year enterprise which employs north of 30,000 people a year (including thousands of student jobs). I don\\'t know what the \"percentage\" of \"wasted\" or \"poorly managed\" money would be, but my impression is not that it\\'s most of the money...

We should keep calling out bullshit as we see it, but we cannot over index on it. \\n\\nOtherwise, I\\'ve recently learned that when it comes to things like GSI funding. The central campus only funds about 60% of the instructional costs for a course. (Readers, GSIs, and lecturer faculty - full profs are different.) Departments are expected to \"make up\" the 40% through various external funds. Some of those are donations, some are fees from professional programs or summer courses, and some are money from each college.  \\nDonations and truly help fund teaching and running of smaller programs, especially if you give to individual programs or earmark them.\\n\\nMost major building initiative in recent years at Berkeley has used some form of donations -- though often these are large anonymous donors. But maintaining the campus is a hundreds of millions dollars per year endeavor. State funds certainly play a big role here, but they don\\'t do it alone. \\n\\nMore than ¬º of freshmen are first get students; nearly one half of transfers are too. Berkeley is in the process of becoming a dedicated Hispanic Serving Institution. And yet, there\\'s still so much to improve on! We are among some of the largest Universities in the country, and yet we operate on a level that so few do!\\n\\nNone of this is to say that we shouldn\\'t keep fighting for more state funds.

Trust me, there\\'s a lot of it! \\n\\nBut there\\'s a lot of BS in industry, and in the nonprofit sector, and well, most places.

But maybe Berkeley isn\\'t the right place for you to learn CS given all the time you have spent on this one course. Students will always pick the college that is the most \"prestigious\" of those they get into, but I feel like they often forget that fit is important too. CS at Berkeley is probably not the fit you are looking for, especially if you are interested in being physically and mentally healthy. And I don\\'t think Berkeley should decrease its rigor to accommodate for this, because there are plenty of students who need and crave this rigor.\\n\\nThis is pretty contradictory. You are on the one hand saying you‚Äôre not trying to to gatekeep CS, but on the other hand saying CS isn‚Äôt for people to whom discrete math doesn‚Äôt come quickly.\\n\\nWell, one doesn‚Äôt have to read hard between the lines to know for whom discrete math doesn‚Äôt come quickly.\\n\\nThe CS program at Berkeley doesn‚Äôt need to decrease ‚Äúrigor‚Äù, whatever that means, in order to reduce the *pace* of this one course. To be frank, it sounds like you‚Äôre using ‚Äúrigor‚Äù as a synonym for ‚Äúbeing very challenging‚Äù.\\n\\nI was at MIT for undergrad nearly 20 years ago now, and the same complaints were often heard there about 6.042: it covers too much, it‚Äôs not relevant outside theory, etc. ‚Äî and all those arguments have a kernel of truth. It‚Äôs not about the ‚Äúcaliber‚Äù of the students you‚Äôre implying the original poster doesn‚Äôt measure up to, either: plenty of MIT undergrads struggled in 6.042 too. \\n\\nThe truth is that a strong background in discrete math and probability in the style of CS 70 is absolutely needed for strong CS research across many subfields. The ability to learn material like this quickly is probably a strong predictor of success there. But if, as another commenter suggests, most students are merely pattern matching their way through CS 70, and not really learning how to think mathematically, then it is a wasted opportunity that merely causes a great deal of pain and doesn‚Äôt serve its stated purpose. \\n\\nSplitting the class so that 80% of Berkeley CS undergrads learn to think mathematically ‚Äî instead of just the 20% that could already do it when they got here ‚Äî might just help everyone, and likely improve Berkeley‚Äôs reputation along the way.',\n",

There is value in learning from a fire-hose as well, and you could make the argument that this is a most important skill (for both your mathematical maturity and your life overall) than fully understanding discrete math.\\n\\n**but** for the students who can keep up with it, it's a phenomenal experience all-around. you don't have much grade pressure because of the curve, and you get a much better challenge educationally than you would with an easy class.\\n\\nthis is a pattern all throughout berkeley. classes are generally aimed at top students, not average ones. this is why berkeley has comparable course rigor (and educational quality for strong students) to places like MIT even though we don't have the same caliber of students.\",\n",

Saying ‚Äúespecially if you are interested in your mental and physical health‚Äù basically says that if you‚Äôre studying CS, be ready to give up your life, and there lies the problem.

       "   '[I\\'m not OP of original post]\\n\\nThis is a terrible post, and frankly the kind of attitude that is part of the issues of the EECS department as a whole.\\n\\nFirst off, the 900 hours thing was an attempt to build credibility that the student was familiar with the ground level workings of the course. It was not the crux of the argument. By repeatedly drawing on this, you are dunking on the poster and committing ad hominem.\\n\\nYou go on to say that if the student has an issue with course pacing, material, etc. That:\\n\\n>I\\'m going to be entirely frank and say maybe you should study a different major at Berkeley or study CS at literally any other university (other than like CMU, MIT, etc.). You seem like an excellent writer, probably better than any (EE)CS major I\\'ve met so far. Maybe use those strengths to your advantage.\\n\\nMore ad hominem is spewed here, again passive aggressively believing that this person should not study CS. As stated in the original post, THIS is exactly the same type of attitude the student repeatedly faced in Office Hours; I\\'d hate to think that this post\\'s OP may be a reader or TA actively discouraging people from pursuing this major.\\n\\n>Many students can do it; they put in the work.\\n\\nBut you just made fun of the original poster for how much effort they put in! How can you tell people to \"pull themselves up by the bootstraps\" and then also make fun of them?\\n\\n>By far, the majority of people I know who have received A, A-, and B+\\'s (declaring-quality grades) in 70 have no prior high-level math experience as you have described or even went to a Silicon Valley high school.\\n\\nI think there is a lack of perspective in this message; mathematical rigor is in the eye of the beholder. Disproportionately, minority and low-income students end up with math curriculums that are not great. They are not offered even AP Calc (which may seem like child\\'s play to this OP, apparently). These are the people who are really cut out by the format of 70. The original post cited statistics for 61A and course staff; this is a wishy-washy explanation based on some personal experience. There is an equity issue here; stating that there isn\\'t is ignorant and harmful.\\n\\n>A lot of students come here instead of those schools because they crave depth and challenge. They don\\'t care about highlighted theorems or color-coded notes too much.\\n\\nI am actually one of these students, so I see where you\\'re coming from. However, I think if a student wants more difficulty they can just take a high unit count and advanced courses. Furthermore, a class shouldn\\'t kowtow to these top 5% of students, but really the students that are struggling while putting effort in. You\\'ve gotta remember 95% of people are coming to college to get a degree, not masochistically challenge themselves. Most importantly, \"making things rigorous\" is no excuse for making things opaque or tricky! The difficulty of the class should come from the concepts themselves, not deciphering their presentation!\\n\\nA question that then might be raised regarding equity and presentation is how one might fix these things. For that, I\\'d say go read the original post, it has some great insights.',\n",
       "   'About the CS70 notes, I think the ability to read mathematical texts is fundamentally a learned skill. If you came from a background where a lot of the math you learned was from texts, you are trained to be able to follow very terse writing and solution \"outlines\" that skip steps. Anyone who\\'s done high school math contests or read a college math textbook (ahem, Rudin) knows it\\'s so common practice to have books just skip steps and leave the rest as an exercise to the reader that it\\'s literally a meme. But think about this, I bet most kids in high school have less read than 20 pages of a math textbook in THEIR LIFE. They aren\\'t used to reading the terse language that math (also cs theory and physics textbooks \\\\*cough Jackson electrodynamics\\\\*) authors usually write in. When you read a math text, it\\'s not enough to just read the words there you have to follow their argument at a fundamental level in your head and this is just a skill that needs to be learned that one that you def do not get from just reading fiction in your normal high school.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR if you never read math textbooks in high school you\\'ll think CS70 notes are not readable. If you have read many math textbooks in high school then be very used to the terse language that the CS70 notes are written in. Sadly 70 notes are written by math people for math people.',\n",

It boils down to the idea that Berkeley CS should be incredibly difficult and exclusive.\\n\\nI‚Äôve worked in Silicon Valley for a few years now, at companies that this subreddit drools over. Newsflash, this shit is way easier than school. And many of my smartest colleagues did not go to Berkeley. They went to the ‚Äúother‚Äù schools that this OP implicitly turns their nose at. I haven‚Äôt used discrete math and probability in ages.\\n\\nOP believes that the Berkeley CS education should only be for high school kids that want to chase a PhD in theoretical computer science. But real life is so different than that small bubble. The work is challenging but it‚Äôs nothing like school. And more importantly, the work is financially rewarding, which is extremely important for those not born into wealth and privilege. So why on Earth would we want to make already irrelevant courses harder for students that need to chase big bags to help secure their financial roots?\\n\\nThe end result is that promising kids that could have totally succeeded in the industry end up washing out because idiots (yes, hot take, idiots) like Sahai and others glorify this ultratraditionalist thinking of grinding hundreds of hours in esoteric topics. It‚Äôs not. The software engineering industry is an amazing place to be right now. For many, it‚Äôs the new American dream. And people like OP and a subset of the CS department want to gatekeep people out of these life changing salaries so they can continue bragging about how smart they are.\\n\\nIf you want rigor there are plenty of 200-level courses to take. Stop sweating out smart 19 year olds, it‚Äôs essentially hazing at this point.\\n\\nTruth is, I‚Äôd be extremely happy to hire the 900 hours person. They have a good head on their shoulders.

But why can‚Äôt steps be taken to help students who don‚Äôt have that experience? Of course some students would feel less challenged if the class was split up into two classes, or had an optional precursor class, or covered less content, or whatever. But why isn‚Äôt the most important thing that people actually enjoy the class and end up learning the material? Why shouldn‚Äôt the notes be color-coded just because it doesn‚Äôt make a difference to you? Why should OP just transfer/change majors because one course took a lot of time and effort for them? Why is this nebulous concept of ‚Äúrigor‚Äù the most important thing to you? \\n\\nClearly the OP wasn‚Äôt the only person who feels this way about 70, but you are acting like these are all just individual problems rather than a systemic issue with how the course is taught.

Cal doesnt offer a whole lot of resources when it comes to their courses which forces the students to really hone in on the subjects. I dont think thats the proper way to teach but who am I to say what the proper way is but I am doing much better at Stanford and my stress levels are way more maintainable.   \\nTo say dont do CS at Cal if youre interested in being physically and mentally healthy is the problem with Cal. I do believe they need to relax because every year i was at cal there were 3-6 suicides, one of them being a friend of mine. To say the institution is not to blame for the amount of stress crippling people is absurd. I survived but my friend didnt and I wouldve loved to share my graduate experience with him (he wanted to come to stanford too). Much love for anyone going through it rn at Cal, if you need help or anything reach out to me or a friend or the therapists at the campus medical building by RSF i forgot the name of it sorry. I burned out bc of cal and it wasnt needed. Once working I kind of resented Cal because i was like really? all of that just so i could do this? but i found its better to help fellow bears feeling lost and thats made the resentment go away bc we all are Cal and if I can help a student out then im helping Cal be better.   \\nI understand how youre feeling because I felt that way when I was going through it but that changed when i lost my friend. He was smart af and I cant even imagine all the things that he couldve done after graduating. its sad but hopefully me sharing this with you maybe makes you help the ones who are struggling. Teaching someone is just as much studying as studying traditionally is and you get the reward of helping someone out. Plus my CS70 professor encouraged us to teach each other even though it seems i was the only one doing it lol \\n\\n  \\nI really wish you the best and I hope you find some kernels of good in this comment bc it comes from the heart. I think CS at Cal would be easier if we helped one another more because at Stanford we have tons of help readily available.

First off this dude sounds like a creeper judging by what you said and other commenters, like who approaches a girl after they already have and know they aren‚Äôt interested that‚Äôs not cool. But-and I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre saying this-you shouldn‚Äôt shoot men down for respectfully approaching girls(by sound of it this guy was not respectful at all). The dating world today is especially rough on men, and approaching girls is one of the few ways to meet them these days and everyone deserves a shot at love imo. I‚Äôve gone on dates from tinder n such but nothing close to me approaching girls or girls who have randomly approached me and I think it‚Äôs good to encourage getting out of your comfort zone and encourage real life talking-I know to some thats a crazy idea in the age of zoom and it‚Äôs sad. Anyways sorry you had to deal with someone that clearly isn‚Äôt going about approaching girls properly and made you feel uncomfortable, I just wanted to lay out some thoughts because I don‚Äôt want guys to read this and feel like omg I should never approach a girl.

Investigators later found that the wooden support beams holding up the balcony had rotted from water damage, and that the firm that had built the balcony had paid out millions in construction defect settlements. The settlements were never reported to the state license board.\\n\\nThe incident led Beary to testify before a state Assembly committee in 2016 and urged its members to support SB 465, which would make California study the causes of shoddy construction.\\n\\n‚ÄúSome of my injuries will be with me for the rest of my life,‚Äù Beary said at the time in an emotional testimony before committee members.\\n\\nThe legislation later unanimously passed the state Senate and was signed into law the same year as Beary‚Äôs testimony.\\n\\nThe Irish Immigration Pastoral Center San Francisco, a nonprofit that assists Irish immigrants in the Bay Area, said in a Facebook statement Sunday, ‚ÄúIt is with deepest sadness that we share the passing of Aoife Beary‚Ä¶‚Äù\\n\\nAccording to the nonprofit, Beary is survived by her parents Mike and Angela, her sister Anna and her brother Tim.',\n",

The question is, how, even if you go out, if you're alone, your mind will still be occupied thinking of her, and this is exactly what I would recommend you to get distraction from.

Talk about something, don't just listen, but try to be involved in an actual conversation.  \\n\\n\\nNext, you might not like what I am about to recommend to you, but you should find the strength to walk away from her completely (politely is optional, as long as you're being civil). The best kind of continuation you should get used in the future is, just some ex, some remote acquaintance.

It condenses years of math maturity and proof experience inside... 14 weeks. It is 4 classes in 1, neither of which is given enough time to grow into the minds of students. The easiest way to resolve the issues is to split the course into a 2 semester sequence that actually takes the time to teach you how to do proofs and why proofs matter in CS.\\n\\nAlso take out the probability module. I understand that it has bearing on other classes in CS, but... there are dedicated classes that teach you the material properly in the departments that teach these things for a living (stats, math).\\n\\nThat said, I also disagree with OP\\'s take on the \"skewed hiring practices\" - mathematics is mostly about imitating the proofs and solutions of other people until you get it. The pool of people who \"get math\" to the level that it is required in the CS70 curriculum is already small enough - would you rather be imitating someone who \"gets it\" or who \"doesn\\'t get it\"?

The real problem with CS70 is that it's a monstrosity spawned by intra-departmental politics.\\n\\nThey are trying to cram too much material because there are conflicting requirements from the EE and CS sides, but the EE v CS rivalry does not allow them to remove material so that what remains can be taught properly. They are also trying to make it ‚Äúsexy‚Äù by teaching advanced topics like RSA, error-correcting codes, and linear regression.\\n\\nConventionally, math is taught by first providing a bit of motivation for a concept, then the concept is given a rigorous definition, then simple claims are proven, then its properties are explored, and finally some proof of a minor or major theorem is given. The proofs are often chosen to illustrate new mathematical techniques. \\n\\nIn CS70, there's some motivation but concepts are not defined with rigor, there's no time, so simple properties are not explored, not shown and not proven, and we jump directly to some proofs that students are not equipped to understand.  Students are in a constant mathematical haze.\\n\\nFor example, to teach error correcting codes and secret sharing, you must first teach polynomials over finite fields. But CS70 does not even define what a field is, and finite fields are given a single lecture slide and a bit more than single page in the notes. \\n\\nI can give many other examples.\\n\\nThis is supposed to be the first course where students are exposed to proofs and mathematical rigor, but there's simply no time for that and the course fails in its most important mission.\\n\\nThere is no textbook. The reason is simple, no one else is crazy enough to cram all this material into a single course. The notes are no substitute. They are a mess.\\n\\nThe massive use of UGSI is a big problem. They are very smart and motivated, but they often don‚Äôt have the mathematical maturity or perspective to teach this kind of course, especially the second year ones.\\n\\nAnd finally, if the department wants to require the student to work for the equivalent of an 8 unit course, it should be honest and list CS70 as an 8 unit course, not force students to give up other courses and any resemblance of social life. University regulations are there for a reason, y'all should file official complaints against the department.\\n\\nOn the positive side, at least it is not as bad as EE16B.\",\n",
       "  \"I see all the comments from CS and math legends. Imagine me, a cognitive science major (and creative writing minor), having to take this class as a major requirement without mathematical maturity or interest to be honest. \\n\\nI had to choose the no-homework option. There was absolutely no way I was actually capable to do the problems in the homework‚ÄîI didn't even know how to start, or enough material to even attempt. \\n\\nFurthermore, as a social learner (as opposed to a textbook learner), I attended every lecture and discussion. However, lectures were disorganized and rushed, slides were not engaging and a mess as well. I learned more from 5 minutes from my discussion review lecture than 1.5 hours of Sen's or Rao's lectures‚Äîgenuinely the biggest waste of my time. Especially Professor Sen, he was just inarticulate and mumbled in speech, disorganized in his thoughts and logic flow, and unfamiliar with his slides.\\n\\nLastly, reading through the post and comments, I liked the author's point of feeling looked down upon to ask questions because it was the case for me. As a straight-A student (except for my B+ in Math 54), I have never felt more dumb and lost. I was confused about the most basic concepts and after attempting to ask about my confusion a few times in a discussion class where it seemed like everyone else was understanding, I stopped trying to ask or answer questions by my UGSI (I felt like a fool having never answered a question asked by my UGSI right).  Another person in the comments were using the example of finite fields‚ÄîI still don't know what they are‚Äîto say how fundamental concepts were not introduced that were built upon for the actual material in this class. I went to Professor Rao's office hours and it was the most condescending and unhelpful staff interaction I have had in Berkeley; I went to him with a list of conceptual, basic questions to ask but he didn't bother to listen to what I was confused about and started going on long tangents and told me I had to read the notes (and started reading the notes with me). I was actually speechless and felt helpless after the interaction. \\n\\nThis semester, I went from Developmental Psychology to this class, which has been so irrelevant compared to all the other courses I have taken for the major (everyone I've talked to, including seniors who graduated, was confused why this was a cogsci req).  All this to say, I want to shout out all the people who took this class out of requirement but the subject matter was outside of their usual academic interest and expertise. I got around 1 standard deviation below the class mean for the final and most of it was by test-taking strategies more than the actual hours of review I put in. Oh, and I have cried four times because of this class this semester. This class was absolute torture. Cheers.\",\n",
       "  \"I think you bring up a lot of good points, but the teaching issues are harder to fix than you realize. I got an A+ in the class and was a reader for a semester of 70, but the honest truth is I still didn't understand like half the material in the class well enough to walk someone else through it in depth - most of how I solved problems was just intuitive leaps that I couldn't fully explain to another person. (part of this might be that I'm not the greatest teacher, but I still believe what you can teach is a strict subset of what you yourself understand.)\\n\\ncs70 is a very, very difficult class conceptually speaking. there are a literal handful of people per semester who genuinely understand the material inside-out, to a point where they can teach it effectively. these are usually the people who've been doing competitive math for 10+ years and made USAMO. my experience has been that these people (as opposed to people that just dabbled in competitive math - making aime 2-3x will help you ace cs70 but isn't really impressive on the same level) are usually the best TAs. using grades isn't the best metric, but I understand why they do it for 70.\\n\\nI think this class would heavily benefit from GSIs with a lot more experience, since almost no undergrads are actually qualified to teach this class.

       "  \"I come from a rigorous math/cs background and also have friends with a similar background and I have to agree with the vast majority of what you said. Prior experience makes 70 along with a whole plethora of classes significantly easier. I also agree with the premise that there are many things the course staff could do significantly better about the presentation of the material. Certainly there are going to be discrepancies no matter how good the teaching is, but it should be the goal of the course staff to bring everyone up.\\n\\nI do think however that it is a bit of a stretch to say that the course staff is making content artificially harder. I don't think neither the professors or the TAs have such malicious designs, and the course policy instead stems from a difference in teaching philosophy. I want to preface by saying that I feel their teaching philosophy is not necessarily wrong, but it does mean there are some significant consequences.\\n\\nFirst, for context, I want to elaborate exactly why previous experience helps. While there is some effect of learning the same content before, that's not all of it. I have a comp math background, but I didn't know about a significant amount of course material (70%). The 30% I knew is a good chunk, but I think an even bigger factor is the level of mathematical maturity that comes from that previous experience. Making intuitive leap of faiths is a natural extension of that experience, and I think that is exactly what the professors are trying to nurture. I don't completely agree with the policy, but I think skipping a bit of the proof such that you have to fill in the gaps is one way to encourage such growth. It's a pretty common method, especially in math.\\n\\nUltimately, the material itself is only a part of what you are supposed to learn. There's definitely a lot of other things (dealing with notation, intuition, problem-solving persistence) that the course is trying to 'teach' on top of the actual course material that are arguably more important. At the very least, that's the impression I get from prof. Rao's mini-rants during lectures. However, it is empirically extremely difficult to develop these skills, even on a 1-on-1 basis. Imagine how hard it is to do at such a massive scale. For better or for worse, CS 70 as it is today is a compromise -- it accepts that some people may not follow (due to inadequate resources), but I believe it at least attempts to maximize the amount that does and get as much as the core skills out of the class.\\n\\nI will end this part by mentioning that I know people who do not have extensive math backgrounds, but have gained significant mathematical maturity during their time at Berkeley. There's also a lot of privileged people who have tried to get into comp math and couldn't. This is to say that privilege certainly has a part in accruing opportunities before college, but at the same time it isn't perfectly clear cut. I believe most are well aware of this, but I think it's important to say nonetheless. While 70 might feel and legitimately be unfair, it's also the class where all those inequalities come to light out of necessity. I'll go further by saying that it has potential to be the class that closes the gap and level the playing field, so to speak. I certainly think closing that gap is part of why Berkeley exists.\\n\\nGiven these thoughts, I have a slightly different conclusion in diagnosing the problems and a set of solutions that will most likely never happen. The main problem is that 70, as a requirement to declare the major, takes the majority of the responsibility to impart mathematical maturity to CS students. One class is not enough, yet it's important that it is a prereq because many upper div classes will require sufficient mathematical maturity not to mention the course material in this class. In an ideal world, I would split 70 into two classes, 70A, 70B, and an accelerated honors class H70 like in a lot of math classes. First would be geared more towards mathematical understanding, the second towards the more specific parts of 70. Splitting 70 would give the needed time to digest the content and develop necessary skills. Anecdotally, one of the best ways to develop my own math skills was to spend a long time with one problem, but the pacing of 70 currently makes that hard to do, especially if you don't have experience before. An accelerated class would satisfy those who do have experience. With the budget as it is, I don't see this happening any time soon though.\\n\\nOn a side note, many TAs might lack significant teaching experience, and therefore lack certain qualities that you mentioned. I think it's important to realize that some TAs are going to be undergrads not much older and experienced than the students so mistakes (to some extent) are to be expected. Please, give specific feedback so that they have an opportunity to grow. Also, as you've said, a majority of TAs have comp math backgrounds, and a majority of bad experiences for you come from people with majority comp math backgrounds. Do account for base-rate fallacies when generalizing your experiences.\",\n",
       "  \">The course is not equitable and heavily disadvantages minorities & lower-income students because they likely haven't taken rigorous math needed and are more likely to work during school.  \\n\\nFacts. It's actually insane how much of an advantage silicon valley kids (you know, the types that went to schools like Lynbrook, Monta Vista, Mission SJ, etc. etc.) have when it comes to a course like CS70. Most of these kids have had significant exposure to multivariable calc, LA, and other advanced math that while not directly applicable to CS70, has certainly had a profound impact on their mathematical maturity which is huge in a class graded on a relative curve like CS70. And that's not even including the easier access and greater opportunity these kids have when it comes to pursuing competition math (AMC, AIME, etc. etc.). Many of low income friends in CS/EECS have stated that they were lucky to even have AP Calc AB (Calc 1) offered in high school. \\n\\nI hope your post gets the necessary traction and spotlight deserves. CS70 is by far the most unequitable CS class at Berkeley, which is a real shame. Considering that courses like 61A have made large strides to level the playing field (precursor classes like CS10, etc etc.) , I have optimism that the situation regarding 70 can and will be improved.  \\n\\nExcellent write-up, OP.\",\n",

In fact I would imagine it‚Äôs significantly smaller if we‚Äôre considering everything, because for a substantial amount of students CS61A is their first time ever coding, whereas CS70 is certainly not their first exposure to math. Additionally, many recommend taking courses such as the EECS16 series and Math 53 in order to prepare for CS70. This preparation simply doesn‚Äôt exist for the 61 series as the only courses available are CS 10 and Data C8, which simply do not come near the rigor of the CS61 series.\\n‚ÄúAn overwhelming majority of students will tell you that lecture is useless‚Äù \\nAnd an overwhelming majority of students struggle in CS70. As someone who went to essentially every lecture, I can assure you a large portion of students did not go at all, however the people that I know that did go (granted this is anecdotal), ended up doing well in the course. I would love to see data on this, and of course this is just speculation, but I guarantee there‚Äôs a positive correlation between lecture attendance and grades. \\n\\n‚ÄúI have spent approximately 900 hours‚Äù\\n\\nI‚Äôm sorry but this is just absurd.

First off I think I agree with this philosophy of not just handing out the answers to students, and the person that convinced me was Professor Adikhari who designed Prob 140, and is an incredible professor. When you have difficult topics like Discrete Math and Probability Theory, all the learning comes through struggling and developing your own problem solving techniques. Seeing the answer just simply restricts your ability to learn. And I think the no-hw option exists purely for the reason of being accommodating. \\n\\n‚Äú61AB has a plethora of resources‚Äù\\n\\nI have to hard disagree with this. In office hours for CS61B it was extremely common for people to wait for 3 hours absolutely stuck on a bug, only to get 3 minutes with a TA that gave them the completely wrong advice. That simply doesn‚Äôt exist in CS70 where there isn‚Äôt the same existence of getting stuck on a bug, and there is always quick response times in office hours (legit the few times I went I was the only one haha).\\n\\nOverall, I think CS70 is difficult because 1) people do not take the proper prep courses to gain that ‚Äúmathematical maturity‚Äù (cringe term but true) and 2) because you just simply can‚Äôt half ass it like CS61 series where you can just spend a couple days grinding practice exams (61A) or projects (61B/C).

If you have strong a mathematics maturity, such as be accustomed to formal proofs or  rationalizing some science stuffs in the past. It shouldn't be that bad. However, if you didn't, don't worry. Just try your best to read all notes before attending lectures. I could say if you could write out any proof in the notes. You are fine with this kind of abstract thinking.\\n2. Lectures cover material in very abstract ways, but the homework really helps you to get familiar with everything in depths. Personally speaking, I found lectures not quite helpful. It's basically reiteration of the notes, but sometimes oversimplifying the nuances of the beauty of this course. So, my suggestion is to spend more time on homework individually. It's completely a different experience from discussing them with classmates because sometimes on the exam you don't have that many collective ideas.\\n3. Exams in summer are much more friendly than in normal semesters. Just practice and train yourself to speed up. It's somehow different from homework because exams usually emphasize on the range of materials and therefore don't have many sophisticated thinking like homework do. Usually, 1 std + on midterm and final guarantees an A and the averages corresponds to B (or B+, a little bit unsure).\",\n",

       "  'Transcription of Daily Cal article by Professor Nicholas Weaver:\\n\\n>The following is my personal opinion. I do not speak for the EECS department, campus or anyone else.  \\n>  \\n>UC Berkeley\\'s electrical engineering and computer sciences department is trapped in a campus that underfunds undergraduate education but also demands that the department accommodate a huge growth in demand. Ten years ago, the department graduated roughly 400 students with Bachelor\\'s degrees in EECS or computer science. This year, the number will probably be 1400, or roughly 15%, of all undergraduates.  \\n>  \\n>A department that has privately tried to hold things together throughout a decade of unprecedented growth now lacks the funds to teach at scale and has to take unilateral action. Thus, for example, CS 70 (a class needed to declare Letters and Science CS), is almost certainly going to be limited to those who were admitted as intending to do CS starting in fall 2022.  \\n>  \\n>The fundamental problem starts with a campus that deliberately underfunds undergraduate education. The campus provides departments such as EECS with a budget of slightly more than $50 per student-credit per hour to pay for both lecturers and TAs. A student in a 4-unit class contributes roughly $200 out of the student\\'s overall tuition for these expenses. Yet the actual cost to a department is more than $350 per student for that 4-unit class, forcing departments to find additional funds to cover the upward of $150 per student gap.  \\n>  \\n>At this point the EECS department is running an annual deficit of nearly $5 million, and cutting this requires drastically cutting enrollment in CS classes. But the deficit is in many ways an excuse to do what needs to be done as no other major campus teaches at this seemingly impossible scale.  \\n>  \\n>We stumbled our way into handling the demand by scaling class resources using undergraduate TAs. We can maintain a pipeline of students who first take the class; then serve as a reader or tutor; then as a TA for multiple semesters. But this pipeline works only if a class is taught every semester.  \\n>  \\n>This technique has allowed classes, such as CS 161, CS 188, and other to each support more than 1,000 students a year.  \\n>  \\n>If we lose one of these classes for a single semester ‚Äî as might happen soon ‚Äî this disrupts the talent pipeline. Now the class changes from one that can support 1,000 students a year to one that can support perhaps 300 as the undergraduate talent pipeline evaporates. Losing just a single one of these scaled classes will be a disaster since the department must provide more than 7,000 student-seats per year in the upper division courses. It will create a situation where there are simply not enough classroom seats for our existing majors to meet graduation requirements.  \\n>  \\n>Repeatedly teaching the same class in order to maintain the pipeline is a recipe for faculty burnout and, without campus support, a thankless task. Dropping the student population by more than 50% would eliminate the need to maintain the teaching pipeline for so many classes, allowing the department to safely offer many of these classes only once a year rather than every semester.  \\n>  \\n>The department tried to convince Letters and Science to shift to a freshman admission model for CS in order to control the size of the major. Letters and Science rejected it. Thus it is highly likely that CS 70, a class necessary to declare the CS major, will be restricted starting in fall 2022 to only the students who actually listed CS or EECS as their intended major, cutting through the backdoor a major that Letters and Science refuses to allow the department to control earlier in the pipeline.  \\n>  \\n>And if this proposal is somehow circumvented or rejected by Letters and Science, it would be natural to restrict CS 70 to \"declared EECS and Letters and Science students only\" in 2023 ‚Äîand, since a student can\\'t declare in Letters and Science until they take CS 70 first, will kill the Letters and Science major entirely.  \\n>  \\n>The money is no doubt a concern. But even if campus would fund the department\\'s teaching (in the end it would cost less than $5million a year, or half of the stadium debt payments that campus took over from the athletic department), the department is still in danger of shattering just due to demand.  \\n>  \\n>In an ideal world, the EECS department would teach all those at UC Berkeley who want to pursue CS. But that would require explicit campus support ‚Äî not only a substantially higher amount of Temporary Academic Staff funding to eliminate the department\\'s deficit but also a willingness to provide more faculty slots to enable the EECS department to grow with the demand. As a department, our student/faculty ratio is three times worse than comparable institutions.  \\n>  \\n>Without this support, the number of students has to be drastically cut simply to avoid the even worse outcome of an upper division class failing.  \\n>  \\n>*Nicholas Weaver is a soon-to-be former lecturer in computer science at UC Berkeley.*\\n\\nEDIT: Apparently Reddit\\'s \"Fancy Pants Editor\" doesn\\'t work so good, and deleted part of the transcription.',\n",

       "  '> Hello folks,\\n> \\n> I hope you and all your loved ones are safe and well.\\n> \\n> I‚Äôve received so many emails about the spring enrollment in EE 120 (Signals and Systems) that I feel compelled to write to you en masse.  Even those of you not interested in 120 might have felt the pinch‚Äîin your attempt to register for other courses‚Äîof what I‚Äôm about to describe.\\n> \\n> For the first time in my sixteen years at Berkeley I‚Äôm forced into the heartrending situation of having to curb enrollment in a course that I love‚ÄîEE 120.  In fact, I might even have to reduce the enrollment size down from its current level.\\n> \\n> The TAS budget (the money we get from the campus to fund the hiring of TAs and Readers) seems to have shrunk across the board, to the point where in EE 120 alone I cannot assemble the team I need.  An absolute red line for me‚Äîone that I will not cross‚Äîis overworking my TAs beyond their appointment limits. Aside from the far, far, far greater moral/ethical abomination of overworking members of my staff, it can also trigger legal conflict with the Union.\\n> \\n> Last I checked, in the spring offering of EE 120 I have about 110 students enrolled, and about 40 students on the waiting list.  To be clear, the bottleneck is NOT room capacity.  The classroom assigned to me houses 149 students.  The bottleneck is my anemic TA budget.  I can‚Äôt hire the staff I need to deliver, to that large a class size, the quality I‚Äôm used to providing.\\n> \\n> In the coming days, I‚Äôll try to tinker with the budget and the TA applicant pool in all the permutations that my 7th-grade can think of, to see if I can find a creative solution.  But the prospects of even keeping the current enrollment size‚Äîlet alone expanding it‚Äîremain bleak.\\n> \\n> Some of you can help in the following way.  If you took EE 120 and did well (A or A+), your overall GPA is up there, and you‚Äôre willing to take an 8-hour TA appointment, do let me know right away, and go online and apply for a position, so I can see you in the database. If you got A-, B+, or B in EE 120, but subsequently took EE 123 or EE 126 and received an A or better, I‚Äôm more than happy to talk with you.\\n> \\n> As an undergraduate at Caltech, I went into the final exam of my second term of Signals and Systems holding a solid A. But I bombed the final and landed on a B+. I know stuff like that happens. But subsequent courses provide second and third chances. I made virtually a career of teaching this material. So, talk to me if you have a passion for teaching the subject.\\n> \\n> Those of you already on the waiting list for the course can feel free to stay on it, But, please, don‚Äôt wait at the expense of other opportunities that may come your way.  I don‚Äôt want you to sacrifice the chance at getting into another worthwhile course while you wait for what appears now as an unlikely opening in EE 120.\\n> \\n> I‚Äôm deeply saddened at the mere thought of turning students away from a course with which I have a strong, longstanding sentimental bond. I‚Äôve been teaching EE 120 fairly regularly since spring 2006, and previously its counterpart at MIT‚Äîboith as a graduate student and a visiting faculty member on sabbatical.  I love to teach this subject to as wide an audience as possible.\\n> \\n> I haven‚Äôt seen this level of interest in EE 120 since about 2012.  So, it‚Äôs a shame that I can‚Äôt enjoy the lovely company of those among you who want to go through the Signals-and-Systems journey with me next spring, but are stuck on the waiting list or outside it altogether.\\n> \\n> Please forgive me.\\n> \\n> Babak.\\n\\n---\\n> Hi folks,\\n> \\n> I thank you for your support and understanding.\\n> \\n> To be clear, I did not want to give the impression that I don‚Äôt have a TA budget. My problem is that I have an insufficient budget.\\n> \\n> For example, I have a star candidate who has TA‚Äôed for me before, and is well-versed with the labs of the course. But he happens to be a 5th-Year Master‚Äôs student, and they cost $3K more than a PhD student, for example!!!\\n> \\n> If I want to hire him and a PhD student each at 20 hours a week, I go close to $2K into the red with my budget. So, forget about hiring readers! (See the screenshot below ‚Ä¶ as an exercise, try to notice other anomalies in the cost structure).\\n> \\n> That‚Äôs sort of problem I have.\\n> \\n> To salvage this, I need a number of 8-hour undergrad TAs who can shine.\\n> \\n> As for recording the lectures, in the past I‚Äôve gotten a budget from the Department‚Äîseparate from the TA budget‚Äîto do this. I hope I can get it again. But if all else fails, I‚Äôll look for volunteers who are willing to manage a camera in the classroom.\\n> \\n> Warm regards,\\n> \\n> Babak.',\n",

       "  'The way that adjunct faculty are treated by the campus is not fair, which is a campus wide issue, and not something peculiar to the College of Engineering or the College of Letters and Sciences.  Further more, it is a nation-wide issue throughout academia, and that is something I have great sympathy for.  There should be more done to honor the work done by lecturers and to compensate them appropriately, and I would support the campus putting more pressure on the Academic Senate to change its rules on tenure and to amend its expectations to favor people who do more undergraduate education and less research.  \\n\\nComplaints about having to teach the same courses year after year I find I have less of an ear for.  On the contrary, teaching the same course every year allows one to hone techniques, resources, and one\\'s pedagogy to become a better educator and teacher over time.  It also means one does not have to reinvent the wheel every semester or year, which can help.  It has been my experience that forcing educators to switch topics of instruction on a yearly basis has the opposite affect that you describe.  This could be a matter of opinion though, and am open to the idea that we all have different preferences in our work patterns.\\n\\nYour tone is hyperbolic.  \"Catastrophe\" and \"crisis\" are highly emotionally charged claims, ones that do not bear out.  It is natural that caps and limits will have to be placed on courses, that happens all the time across the campus.  There are not unlimited resources to be given to each department for their desires.  You have a history of complaining loudly about campus spending on student life on campus, but you should well know that there is more than one department on the campus and more than one department who\\'s needs need to be met.  More than 1400 students are affected by the activities and and events that take place at Memorial Stadium and thousands more alumni, community members, high schoolers, and visitors from out of state utilize and interact with the campus because of that venue and the myriad of events that take place there, sports being just one of them.\\n\\nAs always, your complaints are misplaced.  The state is where you should lodge your complaints.  It is the state government that has continued to demand that UC enlarge its enrollments at Cal and UCLA especially, even over the lack of housing, faculty, and resources to support them.  It is the state government that continues to underfund education (both K-12 and higher education) and expects miracles to be performed on a shoestring budget.  It is the state that stopped the campus from staying the gargantuan size it already is, and passed a law overriding a court ruling which would have capped the growth of the campus.  In the past decade the campus has grown by 10,000 students as higher demand from parents and students comes for more college degrees.  With the Baby Boom generation, UC expanded from a northern and southern campus to opening six more across the state.  In the past 50 years, despite larger and larger numbers of students entering college, only one new campus has been opened, and it is far smaller than its 8 other sisters (Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, and Riverside could all do with expansion as well).  Such issues need to be handled at the state level and the UC system level if things are to be properly addressed.  Cal cannot continue to grow, but that is the expectation that both Sacramento and Oakland have placed upon it.  The campus administration can only do what it can when given that box to work within, and its choices are limited.',\n",

Unfortunately, a consequence of this is that such people are often hesitant to speak up, and as a result you can feel that you\\'re the only one struggling because most of the others in the group who are dealing with the same things you are aren\\'t talking as much.\\n\\nYour performance in 70 and 170 aren\\'t what will determine your future and your career (unless you intend to go into theory research or something).

People who are confident in their abilities and/or have prior exposure to the subject can hop right into 61A, while CS8 and Data 100 give people some more time to get some intuition and familiarity with the ideas before starting the fast-paced (and high-stakes, for people who need to pass a GPA class) classes.\\n\\nHowever, for 70, there\\'s no such universally agreed-on and recommended precursor class; everyone is thrown into the deep end by the second or third week of class, so people like OP end up being put on the same curve as people who have seen 70% of the material before. It\\'s not *impossible* to catch up, but it does require a massive time investment and can often feel overwhelming, especially as an introduction to the major. \\n\\nSo... for people here who have taken 70 and struggled - do you think that there are certain things you would have wished you\\'d seen earlier that would have helped you in the class? My understanding is the undergrad lower-division math classes don\\'t really help with 70, since they teach a different set of skills, so I\\'m wondering if it would be a good idea to create (perhaps informally at first, as a decal, before pitching it as a real class) a \"pre-70\" class as a gentler introduction to some of 70.',\n",

But maybe Berkeley isn\\'t the right place for you to learn CS given all the time you have spent on this one course. Students will always pick the college that is the most \"prestigious\" of those they get into, but I feel like they often forget that fit is important too. CS at Berkeley is probably not the fit you are looking for, especially if you are interested in being physically and mentally healthy. And I don\\'t think Berkeley should decrease its rigor to accommodate for this, because there are plenty of students who need and crave this rigor.\\n\\nThis is pretty contradictory. You are on the one hand saying you‚Äôre not trying to to gatekeep CS, but on the other hand saying CS isn‚Äôt for people to whom discrete math doesn‚Äôt come quickly.\\n\\nWell, one doesn‚Äôt have to read hard between the lines to know for whom discrete math doesn‚Äôt come quickly.\\n\\nThe CS program at Berkeley doesn‚Äôt need to decrease ‚Äúrigor‚Äù, whatever that means, in order to reduce the *pace* of this one course. To be frank, it sounds like you‚Äôre using ‚Äúrigor‚Äù as a synonym for ‚Äúbeing very challenging‚Äù.\\n\\nI was at MIT for undergrad nearly 20 years ago now, and the same complaints were often heard there about 6.042: it covers too much, it‚Äôs not relevant outside theory, etc. ‚Äî and all those arguments have a kernel of truth. It‚Äôs not about the ‚Äúcaliber‚Äù of the students you‚Äôre implying the original poster doesn‚Äôt measure up to, either: plenty of MIT undergrads struggled in 6.042 too. \\n\\nThe truth is that a strong background in discrete math and probability in the style of CS 70 is absolutely needed for strong CS research across many subfields. The ability to learn material like this quickly is probably a strong predictor of success there. But if, as another commenter suggests, most students are merely pattern matching their way through CS 70, and not really learning how to think mathematically, then it is a wasted opportunity that merely causes a great deal of pain and doesn‚Äôt serve its stated purpose. \\n\\nSplitting the class so that 80% of Berkeley CS undergrads learn to think mathematically ‚Äî instead of just the 20% that could already do it when they got here ‚Äî might just help everyone, and likely improve Berkeley‚Äôs reputation along the way.',\n",

There is value in learning from a fire-hose as well, and you could make the argument that this is a most important skill (for both your mathematical maturity and your life overall) than fully understanding discrete math.\\n\\n**but** for the students who can keep up with it, it's a phenomenal experience all-around. you don't have much grade pressure because of the curve, and you get a much better challenge educationally than you would with an easy class.\\n\\nthis is a pattern all throughout berkeley. classes are generally aimed at top students, not average ones. this is why berkeley has comparable course rigor (and educational quality for strong students) to places like MIT even though we don't have the same caliber of students.\",\n",

It was not the crux of the argument. By repeatedly drawing on this, you are dunking on the poster and committing ad hominem.\\n\\nYou go on to say that if the student has an issue with course pacing, material, etc. That:\\n\\n>I\\'m going to be entirely frank and say maybe you should study a different major at Berkeley or study CS at literally any other university (other than like CMU, MIT, etc.). You seem like an excellent writer, probably better than any (EE)CS major I\\'ve met so far. Maybe use those strengths to your advantage.\\n\\nMore ad hominem is spewed here, again passive aggressively believing that this person should not study CS. As stated in the original post, THIS is exactly the same type of attitude the student repeatedly faced in Office Hours; I\\'d hate to think that this post\\'s OP may be a reader or TA actively discouraging people from pursuing this major.\\n\\n>Many students can do it; they put in the work.\\n\\nBut you just made fun of the original poster for how much effort they put in! How can you tell people to \"pull themselves up by the bootstraps\" and then also make fun of them?\\n\\n>By far, the majority of people I know who have received A, A-, and B+\\'s (declaring-quality grades) in 70 have no prior high-level math experience as you have described or even went to a Silicon Valley high school.\\n\\nI think there is a lack of perspective in this message; mathematical rigor is in the eye of the beholder. Disproportionately, minority and low-income students end up with math curriculums that are not great. They are not offered even AP Calc (which may seem like child\\'s play to this OP, apparently). These are the people who are really cut out by the format of 70. The original post cited statistics for 61A and course staff; this is a wishy-washy explanation based on some personal experience. There is an equity issue here; stating that there isn\\'t is ignorant and harmful.\\n\\n>A lot of students come here instead of those schools because they crave depth and challenge. They don\\'t care about highlighted theorems or color-coded notes too much.\\n\\nI am actually one of these students, so I see where you\\'re coming from. However, I think if a student wants more difficulty they can just take a high unit count and advanced courses. Furthermore, a class shouldn\\'t kowtow to these top 5% of students, but really the students that are struggling while putting effort in. You\\'ve gotta remember 95% of people are coming to college to get a degree, not masochistically challenge themselves. Most importantly, \"making things rigorous\" is no excuse for making things opaque or tricky! The difficulty of the class should come from the concepts themselves, not deciphering their presentation!\\n\\nA question that then might be raised regarding equity and presentation is how one might fix these things. For that, I\\'d say go read the original post, it has some great insights.',\n",

Anyone who\\'s done high school math contests or read a college math textbook (ahem, Rudin) knows it\\'s so common practice to have books just skip steps and leave the rest as an exercise to the reader that it\\'s literally a meme. But think about this, I bet most kids in high school have less read than 20 pages of a math textbook in THEIR LIFE. They aren\\'t used to reading the terse language that math (also cs theory and physics textbooks \\\\*cough Jackson electrodynamics\\\\*) authors usually write in. When you read a math text, it\\'s not enough to just read the words there you have to follow their argument at a fundamental level in your head and this is just a skill that needs to be learned that one that you def do not get from just reading fiction in your normal high school.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR if you never read math textbooks in high school you\\'ll think CS70 notes are not readable.

Of course some students would feel less challenged if the class was split up into two classes, or had an optional precursor class, or covered less content, or whatever.

Why shouldn‚Äôt the notes be color-coded just because it doesn‚Äôt make a difference to you? Why should OP just transfer/change majors because one course took a lot of time and effort for them?
