Godspeed to anyone who reads any sentence of this.\\n\\n[here is the last post for context (?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/u2csl0/crispest_water_on_campus/)\\n\\nArmed with the curated list of the recommendations of the last post, i put on my urban hiking (aka gentrified walking) playlist and I tried the crispest fountains of youth this campus cradles.\\n\\nMethodology:\\n\\nI condensed the list to only include potable water sources. I didn't try blackwell, because I don't know anyone who lives there and i am not trying to trespass. Further, I excluded the recommendation of the gym fountain, because I have an intensity about me that I fear would turn me into a gym bro if I set foot in a gym. I do not wish this fate upon myself so I am guarding my feeble sanctity by not crossing the gym line. Next, I opted for a non insulated metal water bottle so that leftover chill from previous water fountains could not influence the taste of the next water fountain in the case fountains were tried consecutively.\\n\\nAt this point we reach a Shakespearean impasse: to spit or to swallow, that is the question. Whether ‚Äòtis nobler to only taste the water fountain or to become bloated from all the water I consume in one day trying to hit up all the fountains. Normally when faced with this impasse, I gargle. You would be surprised how little liquid it takes to gargle. However, for the sake of science I chose to swallow all of the water I tasted.\\n\\nImportantly, fountains were tried on different days. Peer reviewers have pointed out this weakness in the methodology. However, a good fountain will consistently spit good crisp fluids into the crevices of a bottle even if there was no other water bottle filling action before the current fill, so the day of fill should not impact the crispness of water.\\n\\nScoring: **Anxiety (A)** was scored out of 2 (0 being please let the hot light of god shine upon me so that I may evaporate from this dreadful world and 2 being luxuriating in comfort). Anxiety noted the fearsome echo of the water bottle fill in comparison to a quite yet populated environment, general amount of people around (I don‚Äôt like having more than one person looking at me at any given moment), and if any worrisome leaks surrounded the fountain.\\n\\n**Beauty (B)** was scored out of 3. Beauty includes any general aesthetics surrounding the fountain experience.\\n\\n**Crispness (C)** was the main scoring factor which is only fair given the list‚Äôs method of curation. As is such, crispness was scored out of 10. Crispness includes freshness of taste and bone chilling temperatures. I wanted the water to transport me to Antarctica so vividly that I could remember if Antarctica was at the bottom or top of the globe.\\n\\n14. The opulent vlsb fountain: 4 = A: 1, B: 3, C: 0\\n\\nI could make tea with this tepid water.\\n\\n13. 4th floor of etch to the right when exiting the main elevator: 5 = A: 2, B: 1, C: 2\\n\\nThe only thing i can say is that thankfully with time this water will end up in the toilet where it belongs. Disliked! Blocked!\\n\\n12. Cory hall fountain near supernode: 7 = A:-1, B: 4, C: 4\\n\\nFear of eecs peoples societal superiority over a shivering social science girlie factored into anxiety. However, I confuse fear and admiration, so my type is eecs boys. The raw Chad eecs energy that made me scared of being hurt boosted the beauty ranking (i recommend texting that sentiment of being scared of being hurt to a pretty eecs goat with an accidental mullet at 1am so that you can speed run your feral phase. Oops lol sorry). These two biases balance out each other as a net neutral in the score. Controversially, I believe the water itself is actually overhyped.\\n\\n11. first floor physics north and 3rd floor at the end of the hall: 7 = A: 2, B: 1, C: 4\\n\\nYou could go through the trouble of measuring the temperature of this water in kelvin only to find it is room temperature\\n\\n10. asuc near amazon storefront: 7.1 = A: 1.8, B: 1, C: 4.3\\n\\ni had to deduct from the anxiety ranking since my shoes for crews non-slip new balances sounded like spongebob squeaky boots walking to the fountain. Though, it sure was water.\\n\\n9. 3rd floor of doe library by art history/classics: 7.3 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 2.3\\n\\nWith the amount of noise this fountain was making i expected water so cold even sigma freud would have penis envy of this spout. Yet i received nothing of the sort.\\n\\n8. Gianni hall: 8 = A: 2, B: 2, C: 4\\n\\nhell is colder than this water\\n\\n7. kroeber hall fountain, first floor: 8 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 3\\n\\npeople who use sensodyne toothpaste will enjoy the water of this fountain. I don‚Äôt and did not enjoy this fountain. Though, I enjoyed the house posts.\\n\\n6. Evans ground floor: 10 = A: 0, B: 0, C: 10\\n\\nLovely as always, despite being in a building so bad even the university wants to tear it down.\\n\\n5. campbell hall 1st and 5th floor: 12.2 = A: 1, B: 2, C: 9.2\\n\\nThe fifth floor is marginally better than the first floor. The fifth floor is so fresh that I felt like an Alaskan salmon swimming upstream against all the tasks i should be doing. Unfortunately, the salmon imagery for which this water transported me made me afraid as we live on a campus full of bears. Bears fish salmon. For this reason, this is an anxiety inducing fountain\\n\\n4. stanley hall / the bottle filler next to yali‚Äôs qualcam cafe: 12.8 = A: 2, B: 2, C: 8.8\\n\\nI shivered.\\n\\n3. Haas faculty: 13 = A: 2, B: 1, C:10\\n\\nThe sheer crispness of the water animorphed me into a polar bear. For this reason, I recommend this fountain for furries\\n\\n2. mcCone hall, 5th floor west side: 14 = A: 2, B: 3, C: 9\\n\\nright by a very beautiful patio view. I saw a berkeley squirrel (from afar) which coincidentally is the largest mammal i think i could confidently vanquish with my bare hands in a fight (now give me a sturdy stick and i could take on all the tigers at the Oakland zoo at once).\\n\\n1. Morrison music hall: 15 = A: 2, B: 3, C:10\\n\\nThe parade people who have drank from this fountain have worn a pale yellow oval into the tiles just in front of it. You can imagine them standing in the center of the worn out tile oval filling up their water bottle; and you can imagine all the people to come doing the same, making the oval a little paler. You can do all this imaging while you know that in the present you are filling up your bottle standing in that same oval. That worn out tile was the first time that I saw like the tralfamadorians. And so I thought, maybe I should read Slaughterhouse-Five again. That or maybe i should just touch grass and let this stupid hobby of reviewing waterfountains die. So it goes.\\n\\nUpdate of the update: they moved the elkay from the left to the right fountain in morrison hall. Therefore morrison hall water is no longer fire. This list remains in place but be cautioned that fountains may have changed.\",\n",

       "  '(Re-posted from the CS161 piazza)\\n\\nAs you are undoubtedly aware, there is now a very high probability that the University\\'s lecturers will be on strike on Wednesday the 17th and Thursday the 18th.  As one such lecturer I\\'m faced with a difficult decision.  I\\'m personally treated well, and the reason I do this job is to serve my students.  So I feel like I\\'m betraying you if I strike.\\n\\nBut I\\'ve decided: I will be on strike if one occurs. \\n\\nSo if there is a strike lecture will be formally cancelled on Wednesday the 17th.  I will still be in the zoom room however, and available for any questions people have about the strike, the larger context, and other issues.  And on Thursday I\\'ll probably be walking the picket line itself at Bancroft & Telegraph.\\n\\nBut some background as to why I feel the need to join the strike:\\n\\nThe EECS department individually treats lecturers like me well: we are effectively considered part of the faculty (unlike some other departments) and our pay is reasonable (aka high by lecturer standards, although low by say \"police investigator\" standards). If you are curious, everybody\\'s salary is public and available at https://transparentcalifornia.com/ .\\n\\nBut how the department can treat us is often constrained by the larger university, and the larger university seriously neglects the lecturers.\\n\\nAt Berkeley, 40% of the student credit/hours (that is, actual teaching, you know, the thing that we are supposed to be doing.) is done by lecturers.  Yet we represent <20% of the academic payroll costs (excluding the cost of administrators and coaches!  So just the cost of professors etc).  And this is skewed in two ways: \\n\\nThere are a few Haas lecturers that are paid very well and the EECS department, which is currently teaching a huge fraction of our undergraduate population, has less reliance on lecturers than some other departments as we actually have a few teaching professors and most of our faculty will do one large class a year.  So I suspect that \"40% of the teaching, <20% of the pay\" is really closer to 50% of the teaching and <15% of the pay when you exclude these two outliers, but I haven\\'t run the numbers to confirm that.\\n\\nSo for the larger health of the University it is clear they have to treat those who are actually performing the University\\'s stated mission better.\\n\\nAnd even I, arguably amongst the best situated lecturers in the University, find that the University\\'s mistreatment is frustrating to say the least.  What the University considers a \"full time\" teaching load for a lecturer is just ridiculously high.  As an example, the University initially insisted that co-teaching both CS161 (~450 students) and CS61C (~1000 students) together is only a 60% time job.  Fortunately the department\\'s bureaucratic ninjas were able to fix that incident, but it is symptomatic of a larger problem.  Apparently the University think the time it takes to teach a 20 student class and a 1000 student class is effectively the same, that all our effort is O(1) as a function of class size.  I wish.\\n\\nSo yes, I\\'ll be supporting the lecturer strike.  If a strike happens (now looking highly likely) lecture on Wednesday will be cancelled but I\\'ll be in the zoom room for anyone who wants to talk about this situation and other related issues.',\n",

       "  '# Introduction\\n### Motivations\\n\\nI wrote this constructive critique to motivate CS70 and other similarly dense and not beginner friendly material courses to follow suit in the suggestions I give. CS70 staff likely know who I am and if you would like to have a more in-depth discussion, please feel free to reach out :)\\n\\n### Establishing Credibility/Reputability\\n\\nTo preface: I have (and when I say this, I‚Äôm not exaggerating) studied on average ~10hrs every single day of this entire semester. From 1/18 till 5/12, I have spent approximately 900 hours on CS70 alone, which doesn‚Äôt include office hours or discussions or CSM sections. I go to 4 discussions per week (2 different TAs) and I always stay late to ask questions. Additionally, I attend 2 CSM sections per week, I go to OH every day, I have a tutor, post on Piazza and Discord anytime I‚Äôm confused, and I spend my entire day from start to finish in the library studying JUST 70. Think I‚Äôm overexaggerating or lying? My hours are tracked, 70 also has a log of all my OH tickets, and my discussion TAs, and OH staff can back this as well.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**Why do I feel like I‚Äôm qualified to critique the course?** I have significant prior experience privately tutoring students before and have had substantial involvement in the sequencing, design, and structuring of 3 different courses as well as development of course material at my high school (internationally recognized for one of the courses). And as previously mentioned, I have followed and done everything as recommended by the course staff, Rao/Sahai, and others on how to study/‚Äùsurvive‚Äù in cs70.\\n\\n---\\n\\n#1) Overall\\n\\nLet me be very clear, this course is not equitable. In fact, this is emblematic of a much larger issue: none of the lower-divs (mainly 61A & CS70) are. In 61A alone, prior experience is the single most significant predictor of success; according to Pamela, only 15% of NPE students get a B+ or higher. In CS70, this gap is way bigger and they probably have the data to support this claim; students with prior exposure to competitive or rigorous math at any level pre-college whether it‚Äôs USAMO, USACO, AIME, AMC or multivariable/linear algebra at a local college have a MASSIVE advantage. It‚Äôs a compounding advantage because those with prior exposure need to spend less time to understand the material (the so-called ‚Äúmathematical maturity‚Äù). More precisely, their per unit of time spent has a faster rate of change (their score) versus NPE students. Lower-income students also oftentimes have to work to support themselves while in school, so the only gap-closer (spending more time on the material) is now no longer an available option. I say this as a first-gen student coming from a low-income background where the highest level of math taught at my high school is Elementary Calculus. Not everyone had the ability to take rigorous math nor was put through it. Specifically, my school only offered Integrated Math I, II, III, then ‚ÄúAP‚Äù Calc. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe course is WAY TOO FAST-PACED yet expects students to be able to reproduce every proof from a note that we read the day before. The goal of the class commonly said by Rao, Sahai, and CS70 TAs is to ‚Äúencourage learning‚Äù or to ‚Äújust learn the material and you will do fine.‚Äù This fails to acknowledge that the barrier to entry is way higher compared to 61A or 61B; **CS70 artificially inflates the difficulty of the course by intentionally creating a scarcity of resources** (or not investing time into developing resources), which I would argue is contradictory to this commonly spouted goal of ‚Äúencouraging learning.\" ‚ÄúThis is hard material‚Äù is not a sufficient excuse for poor presentation and teaching of material (both in the notes and in lecture). Furthermore, from my experience interacting with course staff in OH every single day and other mediums, it‚Äôs also clear that the hiring practices significantly prioritize grades over teaching capacity. I along with many others intentionally try to avoid certain course staff in OH because we consistently run into the same one-dimensional math comp explanations. Yes, the material is hard, but you do not have to make it any harder than it already is. \\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n\\n#2) Lectures\\n\\nMy main point is this: the lecture should be intended as an introductory aid i.e a conceptual overview of all the main important pieces of the topic (ex: show FLT proof but not derangement, leave that for the note). This flows perfectly since notes should be used to deepen the understanding and discussion is used for application of the theory.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAn overwhelming majority of students will tell you that lecture is useless (supported by student survey data as well) and it‚Äôs motivated by a variety of factors. I will mainly address the slides i.e the presentation of material in lecture in this section. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nAccording to Professor Sen, lecture slides are said to never be changed or modified in any way no matter the professor (rules by the dept apparently?). I strongly disagree and so does the educational research. Lectures should include more visual aid and more colors instead of just black, blue, red. Colors help viewers stay focused instead of getting lost in a wall of all black text. Colors and graphic images help a ton with conceptual understanding and distinguishing what‚Äôs important and what to focus on. This could be something like putting a colored box around the theorem statement to make it easy to distinguish what the overarching statement is and then the proof in a different colored box can be formatted like a step by step tutorial (literally put step 1, step 2, and what we‚Äôre doing in each step) where every little detail is pointed out. This could be something as small as writing an arrow saying that this part of the expression is to account for the cookies, and this * 2 is for symmetry since bla bla. Most importantly, stop skipping on things you consider trivial- these are things that get students stuck from minutes to hours. Common instances of this are jumping 3 steps in a proof or implicitly making a simplification that YOU consider trivial. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nSometimes, slides legitimately just don‚Äôt cut it and that‚Äôs why you have the lecturer there. They should be there to guide you through their thought process and how they approach it instead of brainlessly clicking through slides. Literally write out your steps instead of rambling out loud what the steps are- literally write it out- write out where we are, then the next step, and then the next and explain while doing it. This provides a visual aid to focus on and the exact thing to associate with the explanation coming out of the lecturer‚Äôs mouth. Again, I can not stress this enough: visually walk the viewer through the proof instead of telling it to them and then having a bunch of slides spam clicked. The reason students come to lecture is to pick up what the slides alone cannot convey and it‚Äôs the rationale for each step, the thought process, the conceptual intuitive meaning. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHere are some exemplar models of good lecturing/slides: \\n\\nA)  [Stanford‚Äôs CS70 equivalent](https://chrispiech.github.io/probabilityForComputerScientists/en/index.html)\\n\\nB) [MIT‚Äôs CS70 equivalent](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video_galleries/video-lectures/)\\n\\nC) [Alec Li CS170 notes](https://smartspot2.github.io/assets/pdf/CS170_Lecture_Notes.pdf)\\n\\n---\\n\\n#3) Notes\\n\\nThe notes are massive time sinks that are unnecessarily convoluted and overly complex for no reasons. The argument that this is how math is presented and that other courses later on will be way worse are bad cop-outs for putting in actual work into synthesizing and boiling down material into layman terms that people (undergrads) can actually understand. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe notes are literally pages and pages full of walls of black text. Add some freaking colors, box the theorem in blue, highlight the equation in red, or even something as simple as putting a visual of probability space A and B and their overlap and coloring it, or coloring the cycle of a graph. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIntentionally designing things by selectively excluding clear explanations or step-by-steps doesn‚Äôt help stimulate learning, it just confuses and angers students; for example, a visual step-by-step on how to build hypercubes and assign their bit strings instead of saying it in a one-liner in a gigantic wall of text. Why conceal information about how to deal with E[min(X, Y)] instead of explaining that you could convert it to P(X > t, Y > t)? Students don‚Äôt have unlimited time and it‚Äôs clear that our time isn‚Äôt respected; you can not reasonably expect a student to spend 30 hours on this course alone. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThese are intentional choices made to artificially make the course more difficult and arduous than it needs to be. For students who don‚Äôt have time to spare this has a disproportionately worse effect (this group tends to be lower income folks, minority groups, less privileged). \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe example of assigning bit strings on a hypercube is just one example (off the top of my head) of a concept that students routinely get confused on. If students ROUTINELY ask questions and have trouble with X topic or Y question every single semester, shouldn‚Äôt it warrant looking into? It clearly means that the explanation is not good enough. There‚Äôs a difference between trying to induce confusion to stimulate growth and a clear lack of a proper explanation. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHere are some exemplar models of good notes: \\n\\nA) [Stanford‚Äôs notes for their CS70 equivalent](https://chrispiech.github.io/probabilityForComputerScientists/en/index.html)\\n\\nB) [MIT notes for their CS70 equivalent \\\\(specific note on conditional probability\\\\)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/resources/mit6_042jf10_chap14/) \\n\\nC) [Hug Sp21 61B](https://sp21.datastructur.es)\\n\\n---\\n\\n#4) Exams / Walkthroughs / Recordings\\n\\nTo be blunt: make better solutions or make exam walkthrough videos. Potential suggestion is to have a TA make videos doing a conceptual overview of topics like Sahai did for the Sp2014 semester (can be viewed on YouTube). These short 10-15 mins videos made by Sahai and other course staff are phenomenal material that provide additional resources for students to access beyond just the notes and slides. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nExam solutions should be written like Alec Li‚Äôs Fall 2020 Final rewritten solutions. Every single step should be broken down (stop skipping steps, stop saying X is trivial, blabla) in laymen terms and how to conceptually think about it and the different ways you could approach it. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nI‚Äôve previously spoken with Tarang about past exam walkthroughs. CS70 used to do this in the past but stopped for some reason. His reasoning was that ‚Äúwe want to encourage learning,‚Äù but that is contradictory. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIf your whole goal is to encourage learning, why offer a no-HW option? If anything, by that logic then all students should be required to do the HW not only for structural/disciplinary measures but to also develop a better conceptual understanding. Clearly, this isn‚Äôt the case and by offering a no-HW option the course actively supports the testing approach which goes directly against the whole ‚Äúencourage learning‚Äù goal.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n### Other related suggestions:\\n61AB has a plethora of resources, so that even when you‚Äôre stuck you can find resources to help you get unblocked. Exam prep videos, exam prep sections, NPE sections, videos specifically about recursive runtime, or 61C‚Äôs catchup sections. In 70, you have lectures (which majority of people do not watch), notes, and in-person discussion (if you end up not being able to go, tough luck! If you forget the nitty gritty of what was covered, tough luck too!).\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe benefit of developing these materials starting now is that it will pay absolute dividends in the long-term. For example, students still watch the Enigma/Gitlet explanation videos from 61B which were made years ago. It‚Äôs not like mod arithmetic, for example, will suddenly change 20 years down the road.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nHere‚Äôs what you should do: build a database of resources, reuse it semester-to-semester ‚Üí this reduces the workload of OH, TA‚Äôs, etc in the long-term and also saves on cost/time! That‚Äôs all to say that the second-order effects are huge. In fact, if the whole goal of the course, commonly said by Sahai and Rao, is to ‚Äújust learn the material‚Äù then why restrict resources to force people to interact with course staff? Why create extra barriers to resources to enforce your methodology?   \\n\\n### Suggestions:\\n* Discussion Walkthrough videos:\\n     * Data 100 releases discussion walkthroughs intentionally a week late to encourage people to go to live discussion\\n     * Ex: [Data 100 Fa19 Discussion 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CiUCgSr-Mg)\\n* Concept walkthrough videos i.e RSA, Mod Arithmetic\\n     * Ex: [61B Asymptotics Introduction](https://youtu.be/bBqfehNv7mQ)\\n     * Ex: [Sahai Mini-Lecture on Mod Arithmetic](https://youtu.be/l0DWLBX5d2A)\\n* NPE/Behind/LOST/Exam-prep Discussion sections\\n     * 61A, 61B, 61C, 189, 170, Data 100 all have some variant of these\\n* HW Walkthrough videos\\n     * Ex: [Sp14 CS70 Homework 1 Problem 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkm-YdTJjrk)\\n* HW Introductory videos:\\n     * Ex: [CS61A Fa21 HW03 Q: Num Eights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hihU9yqfndM&list=PLx38hZJ5RLZehTD4yb15G7zKmMEJDHNdn&index=3)\\n\\n---\\n#5) Teaching Pedagogy / Hiring Practices\\nThe hiring practices are based primarily on grades. While Richard has pointed out that CS70 no longer solely relies on an algorithm to assign points based on grades, it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out that most of course staff and especially readers are math comp kids. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nThe main reason for bringing this up is because those who come from rigorous math backgrounds or ones where they\\'ve likely competed in USAMO, USACO, AIME, AMC or taken multivar, lin alg, discrete, etc before even coming to Berkeley are gonna naturally be ones to do well in the course. Doing well in the course translates to better odds of getting hired. And funnily enough, out of the 48 cs70 course staff members who responded to the internal poll about comp math: 27 did comp math in HS, 9 did comp math but only in middle school, 12 never participated in math competitions. Now, I‚Äôm not a stats guy but that looks like an overwhelming majority to me. I want to be clear that it‚Äôs not problematic that they come from rigorous backgrounds, because I have received help from fantastic readers and TAs with a comp math background and they were great- but the flipside is that my poor experiences (as of many others) have mainly come from those with comp math backgrounds whereas I have had absolutely no issues from those without comp math background.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIt\\'s very clear that this is true when a reader/TA gives an explanation that is one-dimensional; one that is likely derived from a math comp perspective. I have routinely had poor experiences with certain readers and TAs in OH, so much so that I along with many other students try our best to avoid them. Do you know how humiliating and demeaning it is to ask for help KNOWING that the person helping you will condescendingly mock you (most of the time implicit or implied, never direct) because you value the help more than getting degraded? In 61A and 61B, asking for help never felt like I was being ridiculed or looked down on. Yet, at 70, I feel it at every step. \\n\\n###Suggestions:\\nIntroducing/encouraging course staff that comes from different backgrounds (non math comp, low rigor HS) would be a great addition. Another focus could be a better filtering mechanism. I like the approach that 61A and 61B take where you have to teach a concept to current course staff who role-play as students and ask student-like questions- teaching extends beyond just grades; someone with an B+ could be a WAY better teacher than someone who never struggled and got an A. If a course staff member feels that they communicate better over Piazza/Discord/Online, that should be a role/responsibility instead of shoveling everyone into a people-facing role which could have an adverse effect. As aforementioned in the previous section, within the content team one of the highly rated TAs responsible for those walkthroughs/recordings!\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIt is SO important that the people joining course staff are non-judgemental, welcoming, and patient. The impact that these people have on students extends beyond just learning, it goes deep and emotional.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**TL;DR: CS70 is made artificially harder by creating a scarcity of resources. The course is not equitable and heavily disadvantages minorities & lower-income students because they likely haven\\'t taken rigorous math needed and are more likely to work during school. Slides and notes have a lot of room to improve, and \"this is hard material\" isn\\'t a sufficient excuse for poor presentation. CS70 should make walkthrough videos (discussion, hw, concept, etc) and not doing so goes against their own goal of \"encouraging learning\" by restricting resources. Furthermore, hiring practices are skewed and majority of course staff come from comp math or rigorous math backgrounds, which becomes problematic when students poor experiences are a result of one-dimensional math comp explanations.**',\n",

Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops.\",\n",

       "  'Important Note:  This is based on my observations at Minion Level.  Theoretically the chairs and deans could do something.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe EECS department is shattering under load due to having gone from 400 graduates a year a decade ago to 1400 graduates/year now. 15% of the University is graduating in either EECS or L&S CS, a load that is breaking the department through a combination of both budgetary pressure and the grind of so many students.\\n\\nThe TL:DR is that the University formula for how teaching funds are distributed (the ‚ÄúTAS budget‚Äù) is broken.  The department gets roughly $200 for a student in a typical 4-unit class, but costs roughly $375 to hire all the TAs necessary, with the remaining $175 coming out of other departmental money.  This departmental funding comes from ‚Äúprofitable‚Äù programs (M.Eng, extension, and summer) and a portion from the University that is basically a function of the size of the faculty in the department, which clearly hasn‚Äôt scaled with demand.\\n\\nSo the EECS department is running a deficit of a few million dollars a year and the only ways to fix it are for either the University to actually fund undergraduate teaching or for EECS to drastically cut enrollment by over 50%!  And it isn‚Äôt a lot of money.  Perhaps $4-5M a year.\\n\\nBut the budget is almost an excuse.  The teaching load is ridiculous and things are failing.  If we lose one or two critical must-teach-every-semester upper division classes (e.g. 161, 186, 188, 189) we lose the undergraduate talent pipeline necessary to support 1000+ students a year in that class.  Even someone like me, who likes teaching, has grown exhausted from teaching just the same two classes on a continuous basis.\\n\\nThe department has to take drastic action.  Last year there was a rejected attempt to reduce L&S by turning it into an EECS-style freshman admission.  Since that failed there is a pending vote to cut the size of the major through the back-door.  By restricting CS70 to just those who were admitted as EECS or CS through L&S, this would cut in half the number of students who declare CS or EECS.\\n\\nThere is an asterisk in the proposal for existing L&S and non-EECS Engineering students but that is ‚Äúbudget permitting‚Äù and, as clearly visible, the budget doesn‚Äôt actually permit this.  And if the department was serious about allowing existing students they wouldn‚Äôt have capped CS70 this summer at just 200 students, since summer classes (due to their profitable nature) normally scale to support however many students wish to take a class.\\n\\nWhat does this mean?  First, nothing is official yet.  The vote result is unannounced, and even then there could be a miracle and Berkeley actually decides to fund EECS to a level necessary to meet demand.  But color me unhopeful.\\n\\nSo assuming it passes, what does it mean?\\n\\nIf you are considering Berkeley for CS starting Fall 2022 but didn‚Äôt select ‚ÄúCS‚Äù or ‚ÄúEECS‚Äù on the application form you will need to go someplace else.  I doubt any policy will protect you, and the department‚Äôs failure to communicate this already infuriates me.\\n\\nIf you were admitted as EECS or selected ‚ÄúCS‚Äù for a Letters and Science admission you should be OK.  Well, in the same sinking boat as everyone else if the department fails in maintaining the upper division.\\n\\nIf you are L&S but didn‚Äôt check ‚ÄúCS‚Äù, or a non-EECS Engineering student, it may be impossible to get into CS if you can‚Äôt get into CS70 this summer.  The only thing that can save you is if somehow the University is willing to provide enough money to actually teach the demand.\\n\\nIf the department had the funding it could possibly develop the will to continue to teach at our scale.  But since I doubt the money would ever come, there is no sense trying to cultivate the will.',\n",
       "  'In light of recent discussions on the sub, I think it\\'s a good time to discuss something that has been on my mind for years now. Here are a few sketches of my experiences at Berkeley over the last few years.\\n\\nIn my class this semester, a Chinese student was being extremely critical of the US, and after agreeing with him on many points, I finally had to say \"No country is perfect, neither the US nor China\". He responded by saying roughly that China is flawless, and US is evil. I responded by asking about the detainment and abuse of millions of muslim Uyghurs in China, to which he replies, these atrocities do not exist. Upon showing him photos and videos he said \"Ohhh you mean the education camps...\" explaining that they are for the good of the muslims in China, and that he supported this behavior.\\n\\nDuring the protests in Hong Kong, I woke up one morning, strolled through Sproul, and saw some flyers posted on a Hong Kong dedicated memorial tack-board in the plaza. I read the flyers about the atrocities committed by the CCP, and a number of Chinese students approached me and tried to convince me this was all untrue. They proceeded to remove the thoughtful artwork and anything else that was \"untrue\" from the tack-board.\\n\\nI printed some small relevant infographics of my own in response, and hung them about campus. They were all removed within the week, some replaced by pro CCP flyers, despite other political statements on other flyers remaining in tact for weeks in the same locations.\\n\\nWhy is there no consequence for students at Cal supporting genocide?\\n\\nWhy is there no respect for the memorials of friends and family detained or killed by the CCP?\\n\\nWhy doesn\\'t the university take action to prevent CCP propaganda on campus?\\n\\nHow can we solve this problem?\\n\\nEdit: It does not make sense to me that we have mandatory workshops on inclusion and diversity as students here, university wide or in classes, yet the university pays no mind when someone advocates for genocide. Is this not the ultimate form of exclusion and hatred? In general, we want to be inclusive as Americans and Cal students, but could it be our bane that we act in good faith, and include even those who hate our country?\\n\\nFor those who aren\\'t sure why we are having this conversation, here\\'s the recent video that led us here [A Hong Kong student at Cornell University got assaulted by a Mandarin-speaking student for posting up signs that say \"Free Hong Kong\" and \"Free Uyghurs\". The assault left a cut on his left hand.](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/v8qg7l/a_hong_kong_student_at_cornell_university_got/)\\n\\nHere\\'s the sort of thing that I witnessed and described above [https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dddsj7/guy\\\\_tears\\\\_down\\\\_hong\\\\_kong\\\\_humanitarian\\\\_fliers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/dddsj7/guy_tears_down_hong_kong_humanitarian_fliers/)\\n\\nClarification:\\n\\n1. I am not conflating Chinese students with supporters of CCP atrocities, it seems the majority of comments from both Chinese and presumably other students understand this.\\n2. In response to all of the \"read the constitution, you can\\'t outlaw free speech\" posts: I never suggested speech be outlawed, nor has any comment that I have read.\\n3. I think the point is summed up nicely by u/czar_el below, who wrote \"It\\'s the \"tolerance of intolerance\" dilemma.

Botanical gardens: duh\\n2. Go hiking: Berkeley (and the bay area at large) has some great hiking trails accessible via bus, bart or mere hopping over fences. To spice things up, go to golden gate park!\\n3. Go to amoeba or rasputins: show each other your music taste by going through the cds and vinyls. (show off your cultural capital (social science hoes get that reference)).\\n4. Go to Moe‚Äôs: show each other your taste in books. This is a great way to make sure that your date is literate (you never know with these UCB students).\\n5. Establish a sovereign nation within the bounds of Berkeley: this unfortunately stops short of political revolution, but is a great way of quality checking your date‚Äôs political affiliation and making sure they are not a nazi. Further, on the second date you can help other non-EECS students around you find class consciousness\\n6. Go to Mcdonalds: ask for a cup of water and then take a seat. They probably won't kick you out if you don‚Äôt buy anything. This is a great way to benefit from the ambiance of Mcdonalds without having to shell out the money.\\n7. Bampfa: get into the museum for free with your student ID and show off your art knowledge (or lack thereof). For non-artistic students, I would recommend memorizing a list of shades of colors names to use during the date to make it seem like you have both a base knowledge of art and more importantly an extensive vocabulary. For example: make it a game with yourself to use the word cerulean or chartreuse when describing the art (that way you can combat the possible badness of the date with a private game of bingo).\\n8. A pack of cards at a picnic table: this one has versatility. Play go fish, or speed, or an actually good card game like 52 card pick up. Alternatively, you can build a house of cards together and then knock it over. You may realize the symbolism of the latter only when it is too late. such a realization of the fragility of the first few dates with someone may cause you to brainstorm a list of date ideas and aggressively regret your past actions (and texts).\\n9. Go up the Campanile: this is free with your berkeley id! Once you are at the top floor, you and your date can take turns pointing out the best spots on campus to cry over what could have been with a person (who is not your current date) that you never really did know. sometimes you need to get the recommendations of where to listen/self insert into to I wish you would by taylor swift\\n10. Berkeley Marina at sunset (or sunrise if you are wild like that): how romantic! but don't stay with your date after dark, you may get kidnapped :)\",\n",

       "  'It‚Äôs time we talked openly about the enrollment and budgeting crisis that EECS is facing, which Professor Ayazifar alluded to earlier this week on the EECS 101 Piazza. Put shortly, the entire EECS department is in a precarious state. Faculty and course staff are severely overworked and desperately attempting to maintain current enrollment levels without the necessary funding to do so.\\n\\nOver the last 10 years, the combined enrollment of EECS + L&S CS has ballooned from 380 a decade ago to 1,300 this year, which is about 15% of the graduating undergraduate population!\\n\\nThe available budget has not scaled accordingly. We have no new available full-time faculty. The $-per-student ratio in the budget has stayed constant or dropped, while TA costs have increased by 5‚Äì20%, depending on how many hours a TA works.\\n\\nThe only reason that we haven‚Äôt entirely collapsed yet is because a number of upper-division courses have scaled massively, against budget constraints. This means that we have enough seats per year for these 1,300 students to meet their graduation requirements‚Äîbut this is a very precarious situation. If our overworked faculty fails an upper division course even one semester, we disrupt the traditional pipeline of course staff (student to reader to TA), and our upper division capacity drops below what is needed to be able to sustain the current graduation rate (i.e. students can‚Äôt graduate on time).\\n\\nThere are only two options:\\n\\nOption #1: We scale. We need funding from the University to do this, which we have not received. We also need explicit buy-in from the EECS department to support the level of teaching necessary, i.e. the department formally embraces scalability rather than just having scalability thrust upon it.\\n\\nOption #2: We cut enrollment. This was the new, proposed declare-upon-admission scheme for the L&S CS major, which would have reduced enrollment in a way that allowed students from both traditionally technical and non-traditionally technical backgrounds to have equal opportunity to the major. L&S vetoed this proposal. The only other way to reasonably cut enrollment is to substantially limit L&S CS as a program, severely capping enrollment to the courses needed to declare.\\n\\nHow this affects you:\\n\\nFunding per student from the University is going down  while enrollment is going up, so the enrollment situation is only getting worse.\\n\\nThere is a very real chance that an upper-division course will collapse. You may not be able to take enough courses to graduate on time.\\n\\nThere is a very real chance that we will be forced to significantly limit L&S CS as a major. If you haven‚Äôt declared, you may never get to declare.\\n\\nWe truly would love to teach every student who expresses an interest in EE/CS, but we can‚Äôt do it without University support. The only options that are left to us, without an increase in funding, are desperate.\\n\\nCurrently, we would like to pursue a Town Hall with EECS administrative faculty to get the full picture of the enrollment and funding crisis. There is still so much we don‚Äôt understand, and we want to gain a clearer picture of what has been happening behind the scenes. Vocal support will help us to get this scheduled.\\n\\nFor now, filling out our form (linked in the comments) will help us show the department and University that students would like to see change on this issue. You can also join us on Discord (link in comments) where we want to continue this conversation and talk about our next steps.\\n\\nBeyond that, the best thing that students can do right now: Make noise. Share this in the circles that you‚Äôre in. The funding crisis is not a new conversation, only one that we would like to begin directly informing students about and including students in. The general student body will need to be involved for change to start happening.\\n\\n- EECS ASEs',\n",

       "  'Once again it is time for my personal observations & thoughts on the state of COVID and the University.\\n\\nSo far the data on Omicron appears near best-case in terms of impact given its hyper-virulent nature.  Its unclear how severe it is for those not vaccinated but for those who are vaccinated and boosted Omicron does appear to be \"just a cold\", albeit one that would still be very serious for those in high risk communities such as immuno-compromised individuals.\\n\\nAs such although the surge in infections is breathtaking (even more than Delta was, and totally trashing Covid Classic in infectiousness), hospitalizations are only starting to tick up and even that may be due to remaining Delta infections.  We saw this in South Africa, the UK, and we seem to be following the trajectory here.  This is about the best case scenario we can have.\\n\\nThis of course leaves the University going into the spring semester in a really tough position.  If they decide to start with in-person instruction on the 18th they will get a lot of flak for \"ignoring COVID\".  If they go remote-only at the start, they will get a lot of flack for \"overreacting\".   But I bet the University will announce shortly the first two weeks are remote, and in the end I think its the right decision but not for the one you might think.\\n\\nThe reason why this is the right decision is accessibility.  A huge fraction of the student body returning from break is going to get Covid.  A huge fraction of the faculty and staff will.  I\\'m cautious bordering on paranoid and I think I\\'ll probably get it.  But I\\'m not actually worried about it.  But getting it is disruptive.\\n\\nA vaccinated individual who\\'s infected but either asymptomatic or mild symptoms is supposed to isolate for 5 days after a positive test under the new CDC guidance, and IMO that guidance is broken.  [1].  But given such guidance or even more conservative university guidance, a COVID+ is a loss of a week+ of schooling or work if things are in person.  But if remote it is no loss at all, its the same sucky shit for all of us.\\n\\xa0\\nSo my bet is the following:\\n\\nOmicron from a public health standpoint ends up a fairly minor event compared to Delta and Covid Classic.  This is even moreso for the University population that has a vaccine mandate.\\n\\nOmicron from a disruption standpoint however is more significant, because a huge fraction are going to end up infected.  Combined with a university administration that is generally cautious about anything not involving the football team\\'s TV revenues and stadium sponsorships, I think it is highly likely the first couple weeks will be online only.\\n\\n\\n[1] It should be you should isolate until two days of negative on ANTIGEN testing, not PCR, since PCR is too sensitive but the antigen (take-home) tests are basically matching infectiousness with their sensitivity level.  Of course, this would have also required the US to actually approve the diverse # of vendors that make such tests instead of basically creating a de-facto duopoly up until very very recently.',\n",

       "  'I lost some faith in the moral fabric of berkeley students last night.\\n\\nSome might remember: around midnight yesterday, near the durant food court, an incident occurred which brought several police cars and a crowd of about 100. From what I saw, a mentally ill man in the front seat of a car, stopped in the road by two police cars, was having some kind of psychotic break and was clearly unequipped to drive, especially with a woman and a baby in the backseat. In my opinion, police presence *was* appropriate given the lack of safety in the situation, but whether their actions were justifiable is debatable. For one thing, I heavily blame the escalation of the situation on the horde of Berkeley students gathering, recording, watching, and *laughing* at the situation. At first, I thought recording was okay in order to keep the police involved accountable, but I highly doubt that people had that intention, since this man\\'s suffering was apparently amusing to them. I feel guilty for not speaking up and telling people to have some respect, but I\\'m not sure I would\\'ve had much of an effect since the crowd was pretty strong, or maybe I\\'m just a pussy. The police restrained the man, supposedly because he was not complying, as instead of following their orders, he presented clearly an incapacity to function normally, rocking back and forth in his chair and only repeating \"I\\'m scared, I\\'m scared, I\\'m scared, I\\'m scared, I\\'m scared...\". He said nothing else. I\\'m sure that if the crowd elevating the situation had acted appropriately, the police would have felt less pressured to resort to force, as they likely would have waited for the man to calm down, and dealt with the situation in a way that was less traumatic for the man. Instead, people laughed and recorded as he was pulled out of the car by five officers, forced onto the ground to be handcuffed, and restrained with a lot of pressure on the ground for a good ten minutes. Not to virtue signal but the situation honestly made me tear up, and I will never view privileged Berkeley fucks the same way again. Also, this might have cured my imposter syndrome lol.',\n",

He was putting up posters to raise awareness about human rights abuses experienced by Hong Kongers and Uyghurs. A man wearing a ‚ÄúCal‚Äù hoodie confronted, and threatened him in Mandarin. When the victim took out his phone and tried to record the assault, the assailant pushed him to the floor and attempted to snatch his phone, leaving a wound on his left hand. The perpetrator only released him when a bystander intervened, but then continued to tear down more posters.\\n\\nThis was a clear attempt to silence someone speaking up for human rights through intimidation and physical violence. The perpetrator‚Äôs assault not only violated the law, but also the rights and dignity of the victim, in particular the victim‚Äôs freedom of expression.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. Hongkonger and Chinese students‚Äô freedom of expression are being suppressed at American universities by force in recent years. \\n\\nSince 2019, many more incidents have arisen. Last year, participants were harassed at UC Davis‚Äô ‚ÄúStand With Hong Kong‚Äù rally on October 1st last year. Just a few days ago at UC San Diego, the ‚Äú8964‚Äù Tiananmen Massacre Memorial installation was vandalized and destroyed. More examples can be found on the infographic that Students For Hong Kong has put together. \\n\\nAll of these incidents show a serious pattern of harassment and intimidation towards students who criticize the Chinese government‚Äôs various human rights violations, and the result is a chilling effect on students‚Äô willingness to speak up about human rights, despite ostensibly enjoying a constitutional right to freedom of speech.\\n\\nSupport from those in positions of power is essential to fighting this kind of intimidation. For instance, in 2019 the Associated Students of UC Davis passed a resolution titled ‚ÄúDavis For Hong Kong‚Äù that condemned the intimidation and harassment faced by Hong Kong student groups at UC Davis.  \\n\\nWe should be free of fear when speaking up on university campuses, and especially so in the United States, where freedom of speech is considered a basic civil right and social value, and is also enshrined in the US Constitution.\\n\\nIn solidarity with our fellow peers, we urge our allies, as well as students and administrators at Cornell University, UC San Diego, UC Berkeley, the University of California system, the University of California Student Association, and all student governments to condemn such intimidation, assault, and harassment. Tertiary education institutions that promote equality and diversity should ensure that the rights of students, particularly marginalized students, are protected.\\n\\nIn the unfortunate yet likely case that more and more instances of violence, harassment, and intimidation against Hongkonger students and our allies will continue to happen, we strongly urge everyone to pay close attention, stand up for students who are being oppressed, and speak up against these incidents.\\n\\nIn solidarity,\\n\\nStudents For Hong Kong   \\nHong Kong Affairs Association of Berkeley \\n\\nCornell Society for the Promotion of East Asian Liberty (SPEAL)\\n\\nMcMaster Stands With Hong Kong\\n\\nHong Kong Student Advocacy Group at NYU (NYUHKSAG)\\n\\nWe The Hongkongers',\n",

(ExcellentWeather\\'s own note: Flux is u/Flux64 -- a commenter who disagreed with Responsible_Ebb -- I would *highly* recommend reading through [their comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/xio54m/psa_for_uc_berkeley_men/ip64ntg/) if you do not see the problems with this sort of rhetoric)\\n\\n* > My problem is when feminist can\\'t have conversations about this without getting emotional & doing weird personal attacks.\\n\\n* > Women perpetuate this in dating roles when they refuse to be with a man that is financially worse off then them,( especially true with college graduate woman.)\\n\\n* > A lot of men here at Berkeley lack confidence which is honestly really sad to see. You\\'re men & are at Berkeley, you have so much potential to succeed & get what you want in this world. Most of you are high value without even realizing it. Ik MOST gender equality people have turned their backs on us & ignored our specific problems (like the pressure we face to succeed), but you can overcome the pressure we face & make something of yourself. Be proud to be a man & embrace your masculinity if you want , there\\'s nothing wrong with that. \\n\\n* > Princess I don\\'t care enough to make another account because I don\\'t care what people on Reddit say about me like you do.

I\\'ve tried stressing this point on this subreddit before, but there are people who will take even your slightest support and run with it. \\n\\nThe internet is a dangerous place and it\\'s easy to find ourselves manipulated by people who otherwise would never command your respect.

I know it\\'s easy to be antagonistic when there are so few consequences, but you must find a way to be stronger than that. \\n\\nThis goes for the media you consume as well. This \"PSA for UC Berkeley Men\" post has me especially worried for you all. You *have* to find healthier outlooks on life, I beg of you. It truly breaks my heart to see people put so much trust in those who would bring you only anger and jealousy. I will not pretend to have any answers, since I think that everyone has to find their own outlook to live by, but I will tell you that those who seek to divide us *never* have answers.

       "  \"As I enter my last few weeks at Cal, I'm realizing how grateful I am for my 4 years here at Cal.\\n\\nI know this is not a common thing you see at r/berkeley, but I'm serious.\\n\\nWhen I came in as a freshman, I didn't know anything other than the school's reputation for being the best public university, academically rigorous, depressed, and meme-y (thanks UCBMFET). It was so interesting to see people who were friendly, down to have fun, chill, while being so academically inclined. I made a solid friend group (very lucky to have met them), tried out some CS classes (failing a midterm lmao), went to some career fairs with my absolute dogshit resume, and got to know the culture at Berkeley a lot more. I went from being curious about berkeley, while immersing in that jokingly depressed culture, to carving out my own tenuous piece on this place.\\n\\nFast forward to now, I'm incredibly grateful and lucky to have met some amazing people, being part of a community on campus, and have gotten through academically with a sweet job at the end (somehow). Although the professional successes feel nice (but not as nice as you think they'd be when ur a freshman), the relationships I've made with people here are what I consider most valuable. \\n\\nSome nights just made me anxious, but I decided to take it easy (esp after I declared woohoo). COVID took a hit on me, but I learned to take advantage of it. I began to take my losses as some kind of joke god was playing on me or something. My freshman friend group split off? No worries, I'll try to make some new friends. I didn't get into clubs? There probably was something wrong I said in my apps but boo they suck (ended up getting in and loving it). \\n\\nAnd now, looking back, I can't say I did as many crazy things as I thought I would back in hs, but damn, what an experience. I'm so glad I got to take the chance to meet the people out here and simply put myself out there to do more things. I'm p shy, but fuck it. Met some amazing people who I'm grateful to call my friends. \\n\\nAs I see prospective freshmen listening to tour guides on campus, sometimes I think about reenacting a scene from Get Out, but I also wonder how they feel and how it felt when I was in their shoes. Good luck to you all in making your decisions. Berkeley's tough. You'll experience a lot of shitty moments, but you'll also experience all the golden moments on top of the pile that make it worth the journey.\\n\\nFrom the financial debt, the waitlists, the bureaucratic school administration, the workload, EE16B, 1am UC Berkeley WarnMes, glade, Moffit, marina, Campanile, club events, decals, tables on Sproul, Sproul piano (respects to yall who play it), the hell-yeah dude, Asian Ghetto, SweetHearts, Artichokes, Kips, Raleighs, football games, Rose Garden, Sather, Fire Trails, to the frats and sororities, thank you UC Berkeley for the mems and gems. \\n\\nAs Kanye said, Poopy-di scoop.\",\n",

       "  \"The CS crisis has exposed many gaps at Cal. We pay a crazy amount to attend this school (especially OOS/internationals). But are we getting value for our money?\\n\\nLet‚Äôs look at some of UC Berkeley‚Äôs highlights:\\n\\n* **Funding crises**: Berkeley is always short on funds. The EECS department is [**restricting CS declaration**](https://www.dailycal.org/2022/04/08/a-personal-view-of-uc-berkeleys-eecs-crisis/) due to lack of sufficient funding. Professors, TAs, and course staffs are **overworked and under-compensated**, and lecturers almost went on [strike](https://www.dailycal.org/2021/11/13/university-lecturers-to-strike-demand-improved-labor-practices/) last semester due to low salaries/benefits.\\n* **Staffing shortages**: Several **libraries have shut** and/or cut library hours citing ‚Äú[staffing shortages](https://www.dailycal.org/2022/03/10/uc-berkeley-struggles-to-retain-library-staff-due-to-funding-covid-19/)‚Äù. Many students who applied for work-study positions at libraries got rejected, pointing to a funding issue / cost-cutting.\\n* **Technology fees:** Cal has repeatedly pushed extra fees, most recently in the form of [IREF](https://www.dailycal.org/2022/03/29/iref-proposal-violates-student-fee-policy-guidelines/) (‚ÄòInstructional Resilience and Enhancement Fee‚Äô), which is an **additional $132 semesterly fee** to pay for basic, essential technology resources such as Zoom and Google Workspace ‚Äì items that should be coming out of campus‚Äôs existing budget.\\n* **Student organizations**: There is disproportionate resource allocation, wherein organisations such as [KASA](https://www.dailycal.org/2018/04/27/asuc-needs-stop-funding-student-groups-disproportionately/) get more funds, while others with more need/people often fall short. Despite a student org. budget from student fees, many clubs charge a membership fee and still remain underfunded. This may be more an ASUC than Cal admin issue, but it's a problem nonetheless.\\n* **WiFi:** I don‚Äôt think anything more needs to be said about this ‚Äì everyone is familiar with the incessant WiFi frustrations at the tech powerhouse that is Berkeley.\\n* **Dorm housing and meals**: We pay insanely high prices, only to get CalDining‚Äôs tasteless, repetitive, and often **unsanitary food**, which often gets many sick. The housing options are mostly small, shared rooms in old buildings that are not in the best condition, to say the least. As a freshman, this has been by far my biggest problem at Cal.\\n* **Breaks**: Dining halls close during Thanksgiving and Spring Breaks, leaving us (especially OOS/intls who can‚Äôt go home) no option except expensive restaurant meals. Edit: they charge an extra $10 flex dollars in lieu of swipes for low-quality meals at Croads during breaks ‚Äì as if what we‚Äôre already paying wasn‚Äôt enough.\\n* **Flex Dollars**: Bear market etc. products offered in return are very overpriced (even accounting for each flex being $0.9), and frequently unavailable. Most locations where you can use flex dollars are also shut. There‚Äôs no way out ‚Äì flex are mandatorily included in meal plans.\\n* **Tang Medical:** The Tang Center also charges high prices, even after SHIP. Their advice nurse and appointment helplines always have long waiting, and are pretty much useless. They barely made any effort to care for students in quarantine during COVID, and they defer any actual problem or emergency to other hospitals. Also, they monopolistically only accept SHIP for insurance, which on its own is extremely expensive.\\n* **GBO**: Where else will you find a university charging you to attend your own freshman orientation ‚Äì that too upwards of $475 for a hybrid GBO (almost the same even for all-online)?! With this, an additional $380 for three days of housing during GBO. This amounts to **$855 per head**, amassing the university almost **$6 million** for approx. 7000 freshman. Despite this, the orientation is mediocre at best, and **GBO leaders aren‚Äôt even paid.**\\n* **Merch and Tickets**: Unlike most universities, we get little to no university merchandise (GBO or otherwise), and the Cal Student Store takes advantage of this by charging a bomb. We also don‚Äôt get free tickets to any games or performances. Meanwhile, other universities give out not only merch, but also additional goodies.\\n\\nIn the already expensive Bay Area surrounded by college-town rip-offs, and especially given COVID, financial stresses, and inflation, the university should be more considerate about students‚Äô circumstances. But Berkeley clearly cuts corners and milks students at every turn, yet is always short of funds and begging for more money ‚Äì from cold calling alumni at Cal Calling Center, to Big Give (where they raised [$20.7 million](https://biggive.berkeley.edu) this year) ‚Äì all while California is in a [$45.7 billion](https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2022/01/10/governor-projects-46-billion-surplus-despite-record-california-budget/) budget surplus.\\n\\nGiven everything, one can‚Äôt help but wonder ‚Äì where is all our money going? I‚Äôm just a freshman, but I‚Äôve begun assuming that much of what the university does is not for students, but for its own self interest.\\n\\nNow, don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äì this is not to slander Berkeley or scare any prospective students away. Every university has its problems, especially a large public one like Berkeley. And Cal itself is considered top-notch, consistently [ranking](https://www.forbes.com/sites/madisonfernandez/2021/09/08/why-berkeley-is-number-one/) amongst the best universities in the world.\\n\\nBut there are clearly gaps to be filled, and I‚Äôm surprised we‚Äôre not doing more about this, given that we have one of the largest and historically most ‚Äúactive‚Äù student voices in the world. It‚Äôs easy to assume lack of agency, or for your voice to get lost as an individual amongst so many students. But we must come together to go beyond the ‚ÄúBear Minimum‚Äù and **work to make Berkeley better**, pushing for transparency and holding the right people accountable.\",\n",

       "  'I\\'ve been seeing a lot of posts discussing relationship troubles in this subreddit, and it\\'s very sweet how supportive others are here; I figured I\\'d recall something very upsetting that happened yesterday, possibly in hopes of hearing some consolation. Here goes!\\n\\n**TL;DR I made a gift for a boy. He threw it away. I\\'m sad and pissed. What do I do?**\\n\\nLast semester, I met a really, *really* cute guy through a friend\\'s sorority. Although he was a frat boy (I do not associate with Greek life, I\\'m far too introverted lol), his personality was exactly my type: kind, outspoken, well-read, insightful during class, the works. We hung out several times in a group setting, and while the sheer amount of people with us limited our interaction, I found out that we\\'re both huge fans of LEGOs and the Green Lantern comics - the moment he shared his interest in those semi-niche interests, I was done. Head over heels. I\\'ve never had feelings for someone before, until now. The blushing, the butterflies in my stomach, it all felt so good.\\n\\nAfter finding out that his birthday was on the 13th, my friend and I devised a master plan:\\n\\n1. My friend finds out if he\\'s single by asking other frat boys. Conveniently, he is.\\n2. I make a handmade card for his birthday. It was nothing too fancy, just a drawing of Oski with a party hat and a birthday cake that read something like: \"Happy birthday \\\\[Name!\\\\] Hope this year treats you well!\" I spent a good while sketching and coloring Oski, cutting out pieces to make a pop-up effect, and accenting everything with markers and deco paper. The pi√®ce de r√©sistance was this LEGO Green Lantern keychain minifig that I scoured Earth and Heaven for, which I looped into the card by punching a hole in its corner.\\n3. After Legal Studies, I gave the card to him and confessed: \"I really like you, \\\\[Name.\\\\]  I think you\\'re cute and incredibly talented, and I\\'d love to get to know you more. You have my number, let me know.\" With that, I left for the girls\\' Haas bathroom. I was far too anxious to wait for a response.\\n\\nHere\\'s where I f\\\\*cked it all up. Just as I left, Crush\\'s frat friends were approaching him. I could hear every word from the bathroom (it\\'s the one in the Student Services building, so you can imagine if you\\'ve been there lol.) They were mostly laughing and saying \"dude, look at this!\" Maybe my retrospective knowledge distorted what was happening, but it seemed like they were passing around the card and mocking it...which was confirmed when I left to throw away my gum wrapper in the landfill bin.\\n\\nAnd there, I found the card, LEGO dude and all. In the trash. The *trash*.\\n\\nObviously, I swallowed my dignity and fished out Green Lantern because I looked EVERYWHERE for the little f\\\\*cker, but I didn\\'t bother with the card. Regardless, it left me pretty heartbroken. I cried hard last night, and I\\'m having trouble focusing on classes today. I keep wondering if it was my fault for being so forward and just putting it out there without much forethought. Was this a bad move? Did I mess up by thinking a frat boy would like me to begin with? I just want to look for some advice to cope with how I\\'m feeling right now, or how I should go forward with these sorts of things.\\n\\nThis is very hyperspecific so if my former crush reads this, he\\'ll know who it is. So if that\\'s you, I\\'m sorry for venting (and eavesdropping lol.) But you suck. And not because of the rejection, either. There\\'s no obligation for you - or anyone - to reciprocate my feelings. You suck because no decent person throws away a LEGO minifigure.\\n\\n**Also, if anyone wants the keychain, which I guess might be a collector\\'s item because they don\\'t make them anymore, let me know.**\\n\\n***EDIT: I feel so, so much better now, thank you so much for the affirmations! Your kindness has been so heartwarming and because of that, I mustered the courage to go to all of my classes and finish all my readings today, yay!! I will be hiding this post in a bit but I just wanted everyone to see that they made my day and I am so grateful to have such a lovely community to lean on. No more tears I promise :))***',\n",

       "  \"Last night there was a power outage. As a result, and to follow strict health protocols, many grocery stores around campus conpletely cleared/threw out entire sections of refrigerated goods. All kinds of drinks, yogurt, cheese, butter, cream cheese, kombucha, juices, fruit, meats, tofu, kimchi, etc etc. \\n\\nIf youre interested in getting bags and bags of goodies, let me know (DM) and we can meet up to get it. I've done this before and, trust me, its not at all as gross as it sounds.\\n\\nMany thousands of pounds of perfectly good food going to waste because of strict health codes. Not good.\\n\\n******UPDATE:******\\n\\nLocation is Wholefoods on Telegraph. All goodies are in an open green metal shipping container behind the store (go around the right side parking lot). Go as soon as possible tonight. It wont be there tomorrow, and if it is it will go bad!\\n\\nTIPS:\\nBring a flashlight (preferably a hands-free head light). And dirty clothes. Rubber/surgery gloves are good too. There will be more than you can take (even if 30 people show up), so bring your biggest strongest shopping bags and keep in mind the walk back to your house. If you have a bike it will be easier as you can just hang the bags on the sides and walk easily. If you have a car then youre lucky. If you DO bring a car remember that you are in stealth mode, so park it in the dark area near the container. \\n\\nPLEASE DONT MAKE A RUCUS--THERE ARE HOUSES NEARBY. ALSO PLEASE DONT MAKE A MESS THAT OTHERS WILL HAVE TO CLEAN UP TOMORROW MORNING. Just the basic dumpster diving manners. If you dont follow these, the store will start locking the container so no one can get it. Dont ruin it for others in need.\\n\\nPROS:\\nThere are TONS of cheeses. If you have a freezer, then youre in luck because there is even more ice cream. Ice cream is almost melted but most tubs are sealed (so just needs to be frozen and youre good). There is so much ice cream that its overwhelming. There is plenty of other stuff like  spreads, hummus, fruit juices, pesto sauces, etc, etc. There are all kinds of delicacy cheeses and spreads from Europe. Very fancy stuff. Total shame its getting chucked out.\\n\\nCONS: \\nA few ice cream spills here and there, but nothing gross. Remember, everything in there just got thrown out today. Nothing is rotten or expired.\\nAnother con is there is literally sooo much stuff its overwhelming and sorting / going through it takes time (if youre picky). \\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nMy friends and I scouted the area and waited for everyone (workers) to leave the store. We weighed our bags and got a whopping booty of a total 630 pounds of groceries (juices, spreads, shitloads of cheeses and ice cream,, sprouted protein bars, breads, probiotic capsules, shots, cocomut water, etc, etc. \\n\\nIt is an utter disgrace so much food gets thrown away just like that--not distributed to students or homeless or foodbanks--simply thrown away.\\n\\n\\nFor those interested, here is an excellent documentary:\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/KUHdTDwdq8U\",\n",

       "  'Annoyed by the amount of misinformation I am seeing about the Omicron variant and the status of the pandemic online, I thought I would post some information, accompanied by citations, about this variant and what we know about it so far. I have particularly tried to emphasize numbers regrading the risks posed by Omicron.\\n\\nBackground on Omicron:\\n\\n* The Omicron variant of (VOC-21NOV-01 (B.1.1.529)) is the dominant strain of COVID (SARS-CoV-2) currently in circulation in California (95% of COVID cases) and the US (95.4% of Covid cases) \\\\[1\\\\].\\n* Omicron has been shown to be significantly less infectious in many lab models (including rodents and organoids), it is found at a reduced level in lung tissue, and the variant does not bind as well as previous strains to a key protein (TMPRSS2) on the surface of lung cells \\\\[4\\\\]. (Quote from virologist in this article: ‚Äúthe virus establishes a very local infection in the upper airways and has less chance to go and wreak havoc in the lungs.‚Äù)\\n* (Added, 1/9/21, 3:41 PM) Somewhat in contrast to previous variants of Coronavirus, the top five symptoms for omicron infection appear to be: runny nose, headache, fatigue (either mild or severe), sneezing, and sore throat. \\\\[6, para. 2\\\\]\\n\\nRisk of hospitalization from Omicron:\\n\\n* The risk of hospitalization (to either emergency care or usual hospital admission) for the general public (i.e., regardless of vaccination status or underlying co-morbidities) for Omicron is approximately half of that for Delta \\\\[2, pg. 4, para. 1\\\\]. Moreover, the risk of hospitalization for Omicron is ‚Äî as compared to the unvaccinated public ‚Äî 65% lower after full vaccination and 81% lower after full vaccination + booster \\\\[2, pg. 9, table 4\\\\].\\n* Data from the US (pre-Omicron): the hospitalization rate for the vaccinated population is 0.01% (roughly 1 in 10,914 cases), and the rate for unvaccinated adults is 0.89% (or 89 in 10000 cases) \\\\[3, appendix\\\\].\\n* In the UK, the hospitalization rate (for the general public, for Omicron) is somewhere between 41 and 18 per 10,000 cases \\\\[2, pg. 3, para 3\\\\].\\n* Put together, the previous 3 points suggest that for the vaccinated population the risk of hospitalization is very low ‚Äî less than 1 hospitalization per 10,000 cases.\\n\\nRisk of death from Omicron:\\n\\n* Up to Dec 29, 2021, the UK had somewhere between 198,348 cases (these are confirmed by lab tests) to up to 451,194 ‚Äúprobable‚Äù cases of Omicron (via a less sensitive protocol - SGTF) \\\\[2, pg. 3, para. 3\\\\].\\n* Of these cases, 57 people have died in the UK within 28 days of receiving an Omicron diagnosis; these individuals were aged between 41 and 99 yo at time of death \\\\[2, pg. 6, para. 4\\\\]. This puts the death rate (in the UK) between 0.028% and 0.013%.

You might be thinking, \"what the fuck dude, why would you jack off to a general solution?\" but hold up. Hear me out for a second. Just hear me out, please. Just imagine being a cucked lonely virgin. The moment you enrolled to study Mathematics. No, the moment you decided to actually study it and not be one of those alpha brainlets who whine about how \\'lame\\' it is; that is the moment when you declared something. You declared this very statement to not only yourself (in the very soul), to your parents, to your friends and family, to the hypothetical God. You declared that you are a virgin, and for as long as you do not stray from this path, your virginity will not stray from you. You will be a virgin forever. This fact is being taken with you to your grave, just like Newton\\'s Three Laws. Now, I get it. You\\'re a teenager. Hormones kick in. Girls start to look more and more attractive. But guess who can\\'t talk to them - you! Because you\\'re a Mathematician! Let\\'s be real here, the majority of girls won\\'t be studying Mathematics at the same level as you. Whether it be A Level Further Maths, or at university where the only types of \\'anal\\' you\\'re getting are Real and Complex. You won\\'t even get a chance to talk to them, because they\\'ll always be with the Psychology chads, with the Management chads. Heck there\\'s probably even Engineers getting in on the action. But don\\'t count on the Computer Scientists, the difference between us and them are that they will spend hours trying to computationally solve our problem of loneliness. They will decompose the hell out of it only to end up with what we, as Mathematicians, have deduced from the very beginning; there is no solution. You will be virgin for life as a Mathematician (CS is a field of Mathematics, okay). Now that we have that out of the way, what do we, as Mathematicians, do to pleasure ourselves? We solve equations. Honestly, there comes a point where solving equations will make you orgasm. But why so? Is it the excitement of finding the solution? Perhaps this level of satisfaction is what we desire. It is what we will never get after spending so much effort in chasing women. Which leads to POINT 1: Math is like an orgasm. You won\\'t get this reward when talking to a girl. Come on man. You won\\'t get her. But when you get the solution to that hard problem, that truly is the best thing ever. Now for POINT 2: Math is sexy. We like girls because of their \\'thicc\\' or \\'slim\\' or \\'petite\\' body. But dude, have you ever seen Mathematical notation? Greek letters? Heck, even the integral sign is probably curvier than your crush. But the difference is, integration will always be with you for years to come, likely for the rest of your life. Calculus is truly wife material. An advantage to this being that integrals won\\'t be a bitch if you have the brains. If you don\\'t, then you need to train harder. That leads me to POINT 3: Math is good for the brain. Seriously. Solving some problems is like going to the gym. You are training your brain. Writing is a hand exercise. There comes a point where you do so much Math that it becomes embedded within your very senses. This is why pornography, hentai and whatnot just doesn\\'t do it for me. My mind is so clear because of Mathematics that I can geometrically interpret these sexual videos. They aren\\'t all that. Overhyped to be honest. Girls\\' breasts aren\\'t perfect hemispheres. I don\\'t see the appeal in this stuff anyway. Why would you want to look at these jagged lines and irregular shapes when you can see the fully raw, high quality, real deal that is a Mathematical expression?

To being relieved and grateful I was laid off during COVID, as it put me on the course to becoming a bear in Fall this year! Feels like a complete life reset, a second chance at this crazy journey of life, an outright dream. I'm just speechless I was given this opportunity.

       "  \"I am a Berkeley Ph.D. student that just returned to my apartment from a 2-week international trip to find that my bathroom plumbing has stopped working; the toilet flushes very slowly and the sink doesn't drain at all. It was working just fine when I left so obviously something has gotten clogged down the pipe while I was gone. I tried to plunge the drain myself and a bunch of dirt from the pipes came up and filled the sink. I informed my landlord about the problem, and was shocked to learn that he does not intend to fix it at all. In fact, he insists this is my fault and is trying to charge me to fix this. After I pushed a little further, he said that previous plumbing issues (from when I first moved in) must have been my fault and is now trying to charge me for those too. [Here is the insane transcript of our conversation.](https://imgur.com/a/zuhnkyQ)\\n\\nI am pretty sure this is blatantly illegal (working plumbing is a condition of habitability in California), but I seem to be out of options in the short term. I tried contacting [Renters' Legal Assistance](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~asucrla/) but got a note that they are [closed until January 19th](https://i.imgur.com/Rd5V7RH.png). They directed me to the Berkeley Rent Stabilization Board, which is also [closed until January 1st](https://i.imgur.com/yJAOfWG.png). I have been brushing my teeth etc. in the kitchen sink for now - am I going to have to live in this condition until at least January? This is a 1-bedroom apartment that I pay $2050 per month for in Northside near Soda Hall. The only thing I am completely sure of is that this landlord is going to try to screw me out of my entire $2500 deposit when I leave. I'm so tempted to just hire a plumber and deduct the cost from my next rent check (or ask them to do so and not pay for it) but I know that could backfire. Open to advice. Thanks.\",\n",

These guys are really everywhere except in my arms! I can't even step outside the door of my dorm without my eyes being blinded by such attractiveness of guys around me. I really came to Cal because everyone told me that the guys here were ugly and I could finally focus on my studies and work without worrying about partying or catching feelings.

       "  'Relax.  First day of GBO didn\\'t go as planned.  That\\'s okay.  You have 4 years ahead of you to meet some awesome people.  Just because it didn\\'t happen in the first week doesn\\'t mean it\\'s over.  \\n\\nPlease don\\'t box yourself in by saying to yourself \"I suck at making friends\".   The mind is pliable and the world is your oyster.  Telling yourself that you suck and there\\'s no hope is strictly unproductive and makes you feel worse. \\n\\nHere\\'s my advice from someone who made 0 friends until my last year of college:  \\n\\n1. develop a mindset that allows for personal growth.  Believe in yourself and your process.  Don\\'t get pressed over trivial crap.  For example, I had a super awkward interaction at a club and I was thinking about it for days, just bashing myself for being weird.  looking back, it straight up doesn\\'t matter.  Don\\'t let things affect you if they don\\'t have to.  This takes time to learn but is a paramount skill for contentment in life.\\n2. Absolutely join clubs.  I recommend the chiller ones, so people who jerk off over internships aren\\'t there.  Avoid most business clubs.  There are tons of groups out there with awesome people so always keep looking.\\n3. Prioritize your mental health.  If shit is stressing you out, go talk to someone like a therapist.  Learn to meditate.  This is important.\\n4. Sometimes despite trying your hardest, you just might not click with some people.  That\\'s okay.  Don\\'t be discouraged and find people that you vibe with.  \\n5. For basic friend making skills, try to be open and confident.  Be responsive, look people in the eyes, smile, laugh, use expression in your face and voice.  As an introvert I often come across as totally disinterested or standoffish.  I had to keep that in mind and actively put in effort to change that.\\n\\nTLDR:  you\\'re gonna be okay. You have plenty of time.  be confident in yourself and don\\'t be afraid if things aren\\'t going well just yet.  Have a belief that things will work out rather than say they never will.  Join clubs and try improving on things like cadence, expressions, and being more energetic if you\\'re still struggling. \\n\\nCollege is a big transition.  And Berkeley is a big place.  It will take some adjustment.  But good things will come.  If any of you other bears have tips as well please add them.',\n",
       "  'Hi everyone. With the end of the semester upon us, many of us are obviously dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety right now. We all want to do well on finals, and many of us will go to great lengths to do so - but sometimes, we go too far.  \\n\\n\\nAs a pharmacology student with a *lot* of experience with substance abuse, addiction, and mental health issues, some of the things I see my peers doing for the sake of their GPAs honestly scares the living shit out of me. I see my friends and classmates going through Adderall like Tic-Tacs, staying up for 3+ days straight, getting black out drunk at night just to unwind, and worse. It especially scares me that many really have no idea just how dangerous some of these behaviors are. So, I\\'ve compiled a small list of friendly reminders to help stay physically and mentally healthy throughout finals:  \\n\\n\\n1. **More stimulants does NOT equal better performance:** It\\'s an easy trap to fall into; we associate stimulant drugs with energy and productivity - so, when we feel like we aren\\'t getting as much done as we would like, many of us have the impulse to simply take more. *That is not how it works*. Most common stimulants (e.g. caffeine, cocaine, Adderall, methamphetamine, Ritalin, etc.) primarily function as dopamine receptor agonists; they release more dopamine into the pre-frontal cortex, which increases energy levels, focus, motivation, etc. There is a \"sweet spot\" for dopamine levels, however, and surpassing it by consuming more dopaminergenic stimulants generally only serves to intensify negative side effects without adding benefits. Often, ***less is more!*** It\\'s different for everyone, but try limiting yourself to 2 cups of coffee in the morning, or try sticking to 10mg of Adderall per day instead of 20, 30, or whatever the number may be; your GPA and your body will thank you.\\n2. **Things can get very dangerous** ***very*** **quickly:** This applies to substance consumption, coping with stress (e.g. engaging in frequent hookups to have fun during free time), and lifestyle decisions in general. It doesn\\'t take much to cause a great deal of physical harm, and if you\\'re not careful, things can escalate VERY quickly. For example, a short Adderall binge might not feel like enough to cause any damage in the moment - but if you take just a little too much, you can easily risk a heart attack, severe dehydration, compulsive redosing, and even permanent damage to vital organs. You might feel like you can skip a few nights of sleep to continue studying - but if you stay up a little too long, you can quickly find yourself in the depths of psychosis without even realizing it. ***Make sure you are consistently doing all of the things a human is supposed to do to stay healthy.*** Sleep *every* night; it doesn\\'t matter if you have an essay due tomorrow that you haven\\'t started - go to sleep and handle it in the morning. Consistently drink water. Know your limits when it comes to substances. Eat at least two meals per day, preferably three. Get at least a little exercise and time outside. **Your brain cannot function at full capacity if you don\\'t take care of yourself;** if not for your own sake, stay healthy for the sake of your grades.\\n3. **It\\'s easier to drive yourself crazy than you might expect:** This is especially important to remember if you are consuming psychoactive substances of any kind, but is also very important even if you are 100% straight edge. The mind is an incredibly powerful force, and it can be easy to forget that the mind must *constantly be kept stable*. In extremely high-stress environments (\\\\*cough\\\\* like finals week at Cal \\\\*cough\\\\*), we tend to relegate mental stability to the back-burners, justifying such behavior as a natural inevitability stemming from a sense of duty toward our responsibilities. **Don\\'t make this mistake!** Letting stress of any kind run rampant and uncontrolled throughout your psyche can lead to some extremely unpleasant and dangerous consequences. If not careful, you could find yourself in the middle of a hypermanic, depressive, psychotic, or otherwise neurotic episode, and it is NOT fun. If drugs are involved, these risks are greatly amplified; I\\'ve had entire weeks erased from my memory, bouts of very regretful hyper-impulsiveness, and some horrendously traumatic mental breakdowns from combining substances with unaddressed mental health problems. *Take breaks, maintain a good routine, get enough sleep, and do things you enjoy*; again, it\\'ll help your grades!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis list is pretty broad and by no means comprehensive, but I think these are some basic essential things to keep in mind over the course of the next week (and all the time tbh). It all sounds straight forward enough, but I know that actually staying on top of this stuff can be WAY easier said than done - it certainly is for me. Thanks for reading, and I hope this can be helpful to someone in some way. Stay safe and have fun y\\'all! We\\'re almost done :)\\n\\nAlso, I\\'d like to note that the motivation to make this post specifically came from observing a couple of friends heavily abusing Adderall and other stuff over the last few days; as such, I was intending to discuss in greater depth some rules regarding safe substance use/harm reduction, as this is a field that I am very interested in and that I think more people should know more about. As I typed this out, though, I decided this could be generalized outside of substance consumption - BUT, if you are currently/planning on using any psychoactive drugs, I would be happy to share more specific pharmacological information that can help you use safely! Reach out with any questions/curiosities whatsoever, and I\\'ll do my best to assist üòä\\n\\nTL;DR/Moral of the story: Check in with yourself, don\\'t deviate from the ground rules of life (like sleeping every night), keep your mental health in check, and exercise responsible substance consumption practices; good luck to everyone! üíû',\n",

Omicron burns out fast, so by then pretty much everybody will have gotten it and gotten over it, or managed to avoid it.

       "  'Brace yourselves for yet another rant about CalDining.\\n\\nPerhaps it has been over a month since I last had CalDining, and as my friends would say, \"We lost all of our dining hall tolerance over the break.\"  Maybe it\\'s just COVID, but I am outright disgusted with the school for some of the food that they have served.  How can they really be okay with it?  I get that they\\'re trying to save money on the cost of food, but it\\'s still absolutely disgusting that they think serving moldy salads with mealworms is okay.\\n\\nI honestly can not count the amount of times I have gone to the dining hall only to be disappointed with the quality of food that they serve.  Some of it is not fresh at all and has been sitting out for hours and hours at a time.  Food spoils and goes bad, and I\\'d really rather not grab a helping of watery, lukewarm yogurt during breakfast that has been sitting out for probably 4+ hours.  Or some of the meat (specifically, chicken) is very undercooked at Cafe 3.  There have also been a few instances where the burgers are moldy or I found bugs in my salads.  I get that college isn\\'t surrounded around the cafeteria food, but this is just inedible and not okay.  There are also other instances where I strongly feel as if the cafeteria dining hall food has violated many health codes.\\n\\nAs someone with very strict dietary restrictions, I can not count the many times that CalDining has made me sick.  I‚Äîalong with some friends of mine‚Äîhave some pretty severe allergies.  For instance, those who have Celiac are majorly affected by this.  Even when choosing the \"allergen-friendly\" options, I noticed that there is a lot of food cross-contamination from using either the same serving spoon as another dish that has one grain of flour can simply trigger a chronic illness.  With me, I have many allergies, but the most severe one is a seafood allergy, and the slightest bit of shrimp, scallops, or shellfish cross-contamination will trigger any allergic reaction and make my nose runny, throat itchy, and tongue start to feel swollen.\\n\\nAdditionally, It is rather disappointing that they have not updated their menus.  I understand that we have been spoiled with new-aged technology to show us the menus right at our fingertips, but it would be nice to know what the dining halls are serving BEFORE I waste a meal swipe at the dining hall for food that has everything I can\\'t eat due to allergies.  I went to a dining hall today for take-out-style, and I wasted a meal swipe just to find out that the only options are almost everything I am allergic to.  Of course, I could eat the one thing out of the meal, but that is not very ideal for me when I am paying a lot of money for a meal plan and food I can not eat and will have to waste.\\n\\nI also found out that some CalDining workers DO NOT have a food handler\\'s certificate.  This is illegal on many levels.  It is a law in California that anyone who handles food MUST have their food handler\\'s permit, certificate, etc.  \\n\\nAccording to CA Senate Bill No. 303...\\n\\n>all food handlers are required to obtain a California food handler card after completing a food safety training course and passing an assessment\\n\\nKnowing that someone who is preparing the food and possibly does not have a food handler\\'s card makes me very uneasy knowing that the lack of training can make me or many others sick, especially when dining hall employees are dropping the food and putting it back on my boyfriend\\'s plate in front of him.  Additionally, it\\'s just disgusting because they will sometimes pick up a pancake with their gloved-hands instead of tongs.  Gloves are significantly better than bare-hands, I will have to admit.\\n\\nOverall, CalDining, do better.

UC Merced is the only UC that I know of that has announced staying remote next week and their situation is significantly different than the situation in the bay area [1].\\n\\nIn my opinion this is the right decision.  In a highly vaccinated and ideally boosted population (like Berkeley), where the health care system is not overwhelmed, Omicron really is just a nasty cold.  But still a highly contagious one so we still need to plan on plenty of absences over the next couple of weeks.\\n\\nAdditionally, data out of Israel suggests that \"long covid\" doesn\\'t affect the vaccinated.  The symptoms of long covid can be caused by many things, not just Covid-19, and the rate of long-covid symptoms in vaccinated and then infected is the same rate as those never infected in the first place!\\n\\nAnd finally the University is not actually letting its guard down, and if anything is improving the situation.\\n\\nYou are now required not only to wear masks but to wear good masks: No more cloth allowed.  Instead a procedure mask is a minimum, and they are finally, FINALLY handing out N95s to employees (so I no longer have to, but as I do prefer the fit of the Kimtechs and 3M Auras over the BYD Healthcare N95s, I\\'ll still be giving some away to my staff who prefer the Kimtechs or 3Ms). \\n\\nCombined with HVAC updates I am not concerned about teaching in person, and as everyone knows my COVID paranoia is actually fairly high so if I\\'m comfortable you can probably be too.\\n\\nBut at the same time we know that not everyone is going to be comfortable with \"Mask Up and YOLO!\" like I am.  We will still fully support remote students, although we do have to prioritize in person for some activities (notably lab and office hours) for efficiency reasons as those are far more effective in person and we do only have a limited amount of TA time available.\\n\\nSo for those in person, I\\'ll see you in person.

Also, even if they do create an unfair policy, data science is genuinely an excellent major. Only reason it gets shit at Berkeley is because it tends to be a backup. At any other school in the nation and in industry, DS is a highly respected and sought-after major. Your life and career in CS does not depend on a major anyway.\\n\\n2. Berkeley undergraduate CS education is genuinely excellent. There is a reason we are ranked #1 for undergrad CS. We have insane opportunities, and our classes teach skills and concepts at a depth you don‚Äôt see many other places. 61a, 70, etc teach us to think very analytically, and that‚Äôs extremely important long-term. Look at UCLA cs curriculum, for example. Much of their intro classes revolve around memorizing syntax. The expectations are significantly lower, and I thus think they are getting a relatively worse education (even tho UCLA is still a great program). We may be underfunded right now, but that doesn‚Äôt take away from the fact that we are receiving a high quality education.\\n\\n3. Please stop with the removing eecs 16b as a requirement. For one, it‚Äôs not happening. No EECS faculty supports this, and for good reason. I 100% agree that the concepts learned in 16b are foundational to any engineering education. If you combine cs with robotics, machine learning, computer architecture, etc., 16b concepts will pop up everywhere. (Not to mention that Lin alg is super important too) Yeah, it‚Äôs a hard class, often poorly run, with a fuck ton of work, and should probably be 5 units, but the content is good and necessary.\\n\\n\\nEveryone has a right to be angry and critique issues: that‚Äôs how we promote necessary and important change. But at some point, we waste energy being angry and worrying. There‚Äôs no need to threaten lawsuits or do other impulsive things. EECS faculty tend to be on our side and advocating for us; have a little faith things will work out. And if they don‚Äôt, let‚Äôs have a measured and coherent (and not impulsive and angry) response.

       "  \"A lot of the students on this campus and in the surrounding area have negative IQ when it comes to just moving around, especially in a way that is conscious of others. There are many things I stomach, but one of the things that have particularly been getting to me lately is that people will just not give a shit about you needing to use the same path as them.\\n\\nThere were three separate instances today where I was walking a very obvious, projected path where someone was approaching and I had no room to move to the side, and they would just lock eyes with me and continue forward. Other cases I will even be pointing directly where I'm going, especially if I'm on my skateboard, and still nothing (forcing me to jump off at times). Don't even get me started on groups of people who fan out and refuse to make even a single person gap when taking up the entire path, or those that will suddenly turn/start walking in a random direction without looking or giving any indication. \\n\\nIt strikes me as super rude, and is even a bit insulting when I will be walking a sidewalk and a group of 2+ approaches that 0% budges to make any room (or even acknowledge my existence), forcing me to walk in the street or dirt. \\n\\nTLDR: please for the sake of all of us, be a better pedestrian\"],\n",

       "   'It seems from several comments that Luca has passed away. Seeing a bright student like this who certainly walked past many of us in the halls at some point is devastating. As many Bears are, he seems to have been an extraordinary and vibrant person. Even a brief google search reveals the following:        \\n- An article about how he and others returned to his high school to serve on a [panel to offer advice and mentorship to younger students](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/story/2022-01-19/college-unplugged-aims-to-help-students-make-decision-on-future%3F_amp%3Dtrue).         \\n- A [Festival of The Arts Audition Video](https://youtu.be/RhC4-j4rcJI).            \\n- it appears he also played tennis and surfed short board (which is often much more technical than long board surfing). [‚ÄúOther standouts in shortboard were Jeremy Shutts taking a 1st and Luca Elghanayan looking really solid to take a 3rd.‚Äù](https://www.lagunabeachindy.com/lbhs-dominates-surf-competition/).         \\n- [This Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca_abeqOjKt/?igshid=YTM0ZjI4ZDI=) indicates that he also gave back to the school of Chemistry during the ‚Äúbig give‚Äù. Whether it was his own money or his family‚Äôs, he certainly made a decision to improve conditions and invest in Cal, investments that often are not felt by current students but enjoyed by those who come many years later.       \\n       \\nI‚Äôve been listening to the YouTube video of his audition and although I don‚Äôt know him at all, I‚Äôve teared up knowing our community lost a member like this. His piano skills are somewhat unrefined, and I don‚Äôt imagine he was classically trained, but he plays piano just like I do: with much more spirit than skill, and with much more feeling than technicality. He‚Äôs playing bohemian rhapsody, not Bach or Beethoven. He and I went to high school <10 miles from each other, and hell, maybe surfed some of the same waves. May he Rest In Peace.',\n",

From the description on the website (which was all I had access to as a transfer in SoCal during COVID) it seemed that the house I was going to was inclusive while also being focused on black culture and empowerment. I was really for that, and had worked with other black community organizations before and was ready to keep doing my best. It was also my only housing option. I lived there for a year and tried to help the house a lot; I did extra workshift hours and helped the kitchen manager and workshift manager weekly. In the person to person connections, it was great. But on a different level, at council they sometimes brought up that I had other non-black friends (I had two friends I brought to the house, both bipoc), and that my presence as a white person made them feel uncomfortable. In the same meeting they would also thank me for the work I was doing for the house and say I was ‚Äòsetting the standard‚Äô. One time one of my roommates in our house counsel meeting told me that I was harming her experience because she didn‚Äôt want a white roommate. When I switched rooms the next semester to live with someone else that was not black because, you know, I didn‚Äôt want my old roommate to keep up the super passive aggressive stuff she was doing, they made a fuss about that and also told my new roommate to not come back in the next semester. It was a very interesting and somewhat traumatic experience for really everyone involved. I firmly believe that hatred or discrimination anywhere shouldn‚Äôt be tolerated, and I think there is a way to do that while also acknowledging and giving space for black and poc experiences. Oddly enough, their behavior helped me understand their experiences more, but through inducing a small amount of the same trauma they have experienced a lot.

       "   \"The crime situation in Berkeley is complicated because the voters in the area have tied the hands of the Berkeley police in several ways. The area used to have 210 officers, but is down to a historic low of 128 and is struggling to hire more due to a lack of funding and because officers do not want to work in an area where the community limits their ability to do their job. For example, the City Council will not allow the UPD to use ALPR technology to notify the police when a wanted vehicle enters the area. There are other examples of limitations. So, unfortunately, the reality is that this is a far more complex problem that will require the city's leadership/community, the university, and the Berkeley police to support one another.\\n\\nAs for increased security, one thing the students can do is start a change.org petition as a start. It would be impactful if you get critical mass at the student level. The school's admin and Berekely city community need to hear from the students. Or start a letter-writing campaign to the Chancellor and/or city mayor.\\n\\nFlaming one another on social media with holier-than-thou attitudes isn't super helpful. Another thing the student community can do at a low level is advocate for the University's housing project at People's Park to move forward. Are you aware that once completed, the project would provide 100 units of permanent supportive housing for formerly unhoused and low-income community members? There will also be a daily meal service offered by a local nonprofit, access to healthcare, and transportation support.\\n\\nMany in the community are so entrenched in the notion that everyone needs to co-exist with the unhoused or mentally unstable with empathy that we're enabling the current conditions to be the status quo. Some of the recent incidents, like dorm intruders, assaults, battery, etc., have been associated with mental illness and drug use, so ideally, we can address the root cause with supportive services. As the university has said, we can do better for the city's unhoused by offering real shelter, services, and sustenance vs. a tent surrounded by piles of wood chips. The People's Park tends to house between 30-60 people. The project would house 100 with supportive services in addition to reestablishing green space and much-needed housing for students.\",\n",

In its very nature, it is anti 'safe walking at night' because that would involve blocking people from having access to the campus which is non-socialist in principle. \\n\\nThe ironic thing is that in general public schools wind up attracting lots of fiscally conservative people because they are marketed as lower cost alternatives.  Which is only true if your family income is too high to qualify for aid at a private school, in which case you probably deserve to fund a lower income student's education by paying more tuition anyway. But the thing is Berkeley and other UCs probably attract a lot of students whose families' disagree with that line of reasoning and just want to pay less money period. It's ironic.\\n\\nEspecially because public schools take tax-money for the same purposes anyway, but the catch is I guess high income families benefit from their own high taxes via in-state tuition prices being discounted for everyone (including them) in the first place.  In principle, progressive tax rates are supposed to prevent this sort of scenario from being possible, which is again ironic.  As a result I personally noticed the UC system being actually kind of conservative.\\n\\nPrivate schools are usually founded by conservatives, but then over time become overrun by liberals.

How about the assumption that blocking the Sather gate makes a person a dumbass or that there are dumbasses for blocking the gate which in turn provoked the events of last week.  That was implied, wasn't it?   \\n\\nPosts on this thread reak of privilege and lack of life experiences.

Would not be ranting and raving about how the streets are unsafe and blaming homeless people or saying criminals everywhere!\\n\\nThere are many people and students included that had traumatic experiences like this happen all their lives.  Anyone with sense knows that guns are expensive. So how much do you think it costs to buy an illegal gun?  Better yet who has access to legal firearms?  \\n\\nFor reals a person yelling as you walk to campus is threatening or that they make the school and the community unsafe.  Each and everyone should be ashamed of your comments.   \\n\\nThere are many students for whom attending Cal was their opportunity to leave areas similar if not worse to what is now your reality.  How dare you be so inconsiderate of people that been advocating for safe streets all their lives?  Who in eff said that coming to Berkeley was going to be an effing cakewalk.  That type of mentality is the same one that lives in suburbs and leaves their car and door to their home unlocked at night.  In the morning their all shocked that it happened to them.  Or the people who forgot where came from only to be reminded that class and location will not save you from misfortune. \\n\\nAre you familiar with this type of individual that is so disassociated from reality? When they purchased a home in the well-to-do neighborhoods they also bought into the disillusion of public safety.  I think you probably do.  \\n\\nGoing back to lived experience! It speaks volumes of a person when their reference point to a safe environment, is informing how they see the community surrounding the college they attend.  \\n\\nThe most effective solutions come from people who survived communities like this one.   Another thing and its a fact that Berkeley PD is one of the reasons for the militarization of police throughout the world.  Your school was involved with that too. \\n\\nWhen it comes to street life and you get into an altercation things like shootings or stabbings happen.  It's the way of the street I'm assuming you knew that!  If not take it as a lesson learned.  \\n\\nIf y'all were so concerned about safety then you would organize a group of people that will escort drunk people home.  Would build community support so females will not be walking alone late hours of the night.  \\n\\nNah you just want to point the finger like some privileged donkey. Making assumptions based on fear because you aren't comfortable anymore.  \\n\\nI know of a school organization that believes it's safer for them off campus than on.  Also, those students are safer when they are in their study hall.  That no harm will be done to them there.  That is their reality but you are the uncomfortable one cause of some shootings, a fight, and people yelling.\\n\\nThe campus is threatening and so are you thinking too much based on the lies society says of criminals and homeless folks.

It condenses years of math maturity and proof experience inside... 14 weeks. It is 4 classes in 1, neither of which is given enough time to grow into the minds of students. The easiest way to resolve the issues is to split the course into a 2 semester sequence that actually takes the time to teach you how to do proofs and why proofs matter in CS.\\n\\nAlso take out the probability module. I understand that it has bearing on other classes in CS, but... there are dedicated classes that teach you the material properly in the departments that teach these things for a living (stats, math).\\n\\nThat said, I also disagree with OP\\'s take on the \"skewed hiring practices\" - mathematics is mostly about imitating the proofs and solutions of other people until you get it. The pool of people who \"get math\" to the level that it is required in the CS70 curriculum is already small enough - would you rather be imitating someone who \"gets it\" or who \"doesn\\'t get it\"? Or is the claim that there are other capable potential staff who get looked over?',\n",
       "   \"Former CS70 GSI here.\\n\\nThese are all superficial problems. The real problem with CS70 is that it's a monstrosity spawned by intra-departmental politics.\\n\\nThey are trying to cram too much material because there are conflicting requirements from the EE and CS sides, but the EE v CS rivalry does not allow them to remove material so that what remains can be taught properly. They are also trying to make it ‚Äúsexy‚Äù by teaching advanced topics like RSA, error-correcting codes, and linear regression.\\n\\nConventionally, math is taught by first providing a bit of motivation for a concept, then the concept is given a rigorous definition, then simple claims are proven, then its properties are explored, and finally some proof of a minor or major theorem is given. The proofs are often chosen to illustrate new mathematical techniques. \\n\\nIn CS70, there's some motivation but concepts are not defined with rigor, there's no time, so simple properties are not explored, not shown and not proven, and we jump directly to some proofs that students are not equipped to understand.  Students are in a constant mathematical haze.\\n\\nFor example, to teach error correcting codes and secret sharing, you must first teach polynomials over finite fields. But CS70 does not even define what a field is, and finite fields are given a single lecture slide and a bit more than single page in the notes. \\n\\nI can give many other examples.\\n\\nThis is supposed to be the first course where students are exposed to proofs and mathematical rigor, but there's simply no time for that and the course fails in its most important mission.\\n\\nThere is no textbook. The reason is simple, no one else is crazy enough to cram all this material into a single course. The notes are no substitute. They are a mess.\\n\\nThe massive use of UGSI is a big problem. They are very smart and motivated, but they often don‚Äôt have the mathematical maturity or perspective to teach this kind of course, especially the second year ones.\\n\\nAnd finally, if the department wants to require the student to work for the equivalent of an 8 unit course, it should be honest and list CS70 as an 8 unit course, not force students to give up other courses and any resemblance of social life. University regulations are there for a reason, y'all should file official complaints against the department.\\n\\nOn the positive side, at least it is not as bad as EE16B.\",\n",

Imagine me, a cognitive science major (and creative writing minor), having to take this class as a major requirement without mathematical maturity or interest to be honest. \\n\\nI had to choose the no-homework option. There was absolutely no way I was actually capable to do the problems in the homework‚ÄîI didn't even know how to start, or enough material to even attempt. \\n\\nFurthermore, as a social learner (as opposed to a textbook learner), I attended every lecture and discussion. However, lectures were disorganized and rushed, slides were not engaging and a mess as well. I learned more from 5 minutes from my discussion review lecture than 1.5 hours of Sen's or Rao's lectures‚Äîgenuinely the biggest waste of my time. Especially Professor Sen, he was just inarticulate and mumbled in speech, disorganized in his thoughts and logic flow, and unfamiliar with his slides.\\n\\nLastly, reading through the post and comments, I liked the author's point of feeling looked down upon to ask questions because it was the case for me. As a straight-A student (except for my B+ in Math 54), I have never felt more dumb and lost. I was confused about the most basic concepts and after attempting to ask about my confusion a few times in a discussion class where it seemed like everyone else was understanding, I stopped trying to ask or answer questions by my UGSI (I felt like a fool having never answered a question asked by my UGSI right).  Another person in the comments were using the example of finite fields‚ÄîI still don't know what they are‚Äîto say how fundamental concepts were not introduced that were built upon for the actual material in this class. I went to Professor Rao's office hours and it was the most condescending and unhelpful staff interaction I have had in Berkeley; I went to him with a list of conceptual, basic questions to ask but he didn't bother to listen to what I was confused about and started going on long tangents and told me I had to read the notes (and started reading the notes with me). I was actually speechless and felt helpless after the interaction. \\n\\nThis semester, I went from Developmental Psychology to this class, which has been so irrelevant compared to all the other courses I have taken for the major (everyone I've talked to, including seniors who graduated, was confused why this was a cogsci req).  All this to say, I want to shout out all the people who took this class out of requirement but the subject matter was outside of their usual academic interest and expertise. I got around 1 standard deviation below the class mean for the final and most of it was by test-taking strategies more than the actual hours of review I put in.

(part of this might be that I'm not the greatest teacher, but I still believe what you can teach is a strict subset of what you yourself understand.)\\n\\ncs70 is a very, very difficult class conceptually speaking. there are a literal handful of people per semester who genuinely understand the material inside-out, to a point where they can teach it effectively. these are usually the people who've been doing competitive math for 10+ years and made USAMO. my experience has been that these people (as opposed to people that just dabbled in competitive math - making aime 2-3x will help you ace cs70 but isn't really impressive on the same level) are usually the best TAs. using grades isn't the best metric, but I understand why they do it for 70.\\n\\nI think this class would heavily benefit from GSIs with a lot more experience, since almost no undergrads are actually qualified to teach this class.

       "   \"i really and truly appreciate when course staff/tutors/folks involved with the course share things like this. i was a nontraditional/reentry student and CS was nonexistent in my high school and none of the community college courses i took articulated to berkeley, nor were they remotely as ~rigorous as the 61 series/70 expects. i felt awful trying to navigate these classes and my TAs definitely tried their best but there was always a vibe of 'yeah it's hard but there's nothing wrong with the course, keep trying and you'll get there' when in reality it was apparent that students with prior experience in competitive math or programming or who had been exposed to this kind of material before coming in had a huge advantage and when that seems to be an ever increasing proportion of the student body as optimizing your college app and experiences skew more getting towards programming experience as EECS/CS continues to be an incredibly selective major in an already selective school, the expectation becomes that you're already familiar with the course material and the tests become an exercise in pattern matching or gotchas since the content is already known to the majority of the class and the exam scores 'curving' to some average or bin shifting reflect that. \\n\\nidk im rambling but thank you OP for expressing this so well\",\n",
       "   \"I come from a rigorous math/cs background and also have friends with a similar background and I have to agree with the vast majority of what you said. Prior experience makes 70 along with a whole plethora of classes significantly easier. I also agree with the premise that there are many things the course staff could do significantly better about the presentation of the material. Certainly there are going to be discrepancies no matter how good the teaching is, but it should be the goal of the course staff to bring everyone up.\\n\\nI do think however that it is a bit of a stretch to say that the course staff is making content artificially harder. I don't think neither the professors or the TAs have such malicious designs, and the course policy instead stems from a difference in teaching philosophy. I want to preface by saying that I feel their teaching philosophy is not necessarily wrong, but it does mean there are some significant consequences.\\n\\nFirst, for context, I want to elaborate exactly why previous experience helps. While there is some effect of learning the same content before, that's not all of it. I have a comp math background, but I didn't know about a significant amount of course material (70%). The 30% I knew is a good chunk, but I think an even bigger factor is the level of mathematical maturity that comes from that previous experience. Making intuitive leap of faiths is a natural extension of that experience, and I think that is exactly what the professors are trying to nurture. I don't completely agree with the policy, but I think skipping a bit of the proof such that you have to fill in the gaps is one way to encourage such growth. It's a pretty common method, especially in math.\\n\\nUltimately, the material itself is only a part of what you are supposed to learn. There's definitely a lot of other things (dealing with notation, intuition, problem-solving persistence) that the course is trying to 'teach' on top of the actual course material that are arguably more important. At the very least, that's the impression I get from prof. Rao's mini-rants during lectures. However, it is empirically extremely difficult to develop these skills, even on a 1-on-1 basis. Imagine how hard it is to do at such a massive scale. For better or for worse, CS 70 as it is today is a compromise -- it accepts that some people may not follow (due to inadequate resources), but I believe it at least attempts to maximize the amount that does and get as much as the core skills out of the class.\\n\\nI will end this part by mentioning that I know people who do not have extensive math backgrounds, but have gained significant mathematical maturity during their time at Berkeley. There's also a lot of privileged people who have tried to get into comp math and couldn't. This is to say that privilege certainly has a part in accruing opportunities before college, but at the same time it isn't perfectly clear cut. I believe most are well aware of this, but I think it's important to say nonetheless. While 70 might feel and legitimately be unfair, it's also the class where all those inequalities come to light out of necessity. I'll go further by saying that it has potential to be the class that closes the gap and level the playing field, so to speak. I certainly think closing that gap is part of why Berkeley exists.\\n\\nGiven these thoughts, I have a slightly different conclusion in diagnosing the problems and a set of solutions that will most likely never happen. The main problem is that 70, as a requirement to declare the major, takes the majority of the responsibility to impart mathematical maturity to CS students. One class is not enough, yet it's important that it is a prereq because many upper div classes will require sufficient mathematical maturity not to mention the course material in this class. In an ideal world, I would split 70 into two classes, 70A, 70B, and an accelerated honors class H70 like in a lot of math classes. First would be geared more towards mathematical understanding, the second towards the more specific parts of 70. Splitting 70 would give the needed time to digest the content and develop necessary skills. Anecdotally, one of the best ways to develop my own math skills was to spend a long time with one problem, but the pacing of 70 currently makes that hard to do, especially if you don't have experience before. An accelerated class would satisfy those who do have experience. With the budget as it is, I don't see this happening any time soon though.\\n\\nOn a side note, many TAs might lack significant teaching experience, and therefore lack certain qualities that you mentioned. I think it's important to realize that some TAs are going to be undergrads not much older and experienced than the students so mistakes (to some extent) are to be expected. Please, give specific feedback so that they have an opportunity to grow. Also, as you've said, a majority of TAs have comp math backgrounds, and a majority of bad experiences for you come from people with majority comp math backgrounds. Do account for base-rate fallacies when generalizing your experiences.\",\n",
       "   \">The course is not equitable and heavily disadvantages minorities & lower-income students because they likely haven't taken rigorous math needed and are more likely to work during school.  \\n\\nFacts. It's actually insane how much of an advantage silicon valley kids (you know, the types that went to schools like Lynbrook, Monta Vista, Mission SJ, etc. etc.) have when it comes to a course like CS70. Most of these kids have had significant exposure to multivariable calc, LA, and other advanced math that while not directly applicable to CS70, has certainly had a profound impact on their mathematical maturity which is huge in a class graded on a relative curve like CS70. And that's not even including the easier access and greater opportunity these kids have when it comes to pursuing competition math (AMC, AIME, etc. etc.). Many of low income friends in CS/EECS have stated that they were lucky to even have AP Calc AB (Calc 1) offered in high school. \\n\\nI hope your post gets the necessary traction and spotlight deserves. CS70 is by far the most unequitable CS class at Berkeley, which is a real shame. Considering that courses like 61A have made large strides to level the playing field (precursor classes like CS10, etc etc.) , I have optimism that the situation regarding 70 can and will be improved.  \\n\\nExcellent write-up, OP.\",\n",

In fact I would imagine it‚Äôs significantly smaller if we‚Äôre considering everything, because for a substantial amount of students CS61A is their first time ever coding, whereas CS70 is certainly not their first exposure to math. Additionally, many recommend taking courses such as the EECS16 series and Math 53 in order to prepare for CS70. This preparation simply doesn‚Äôt exist for the 61 series as the only courses available are CS 10 and Data C8, which simply do not come near the rigor of the CS61 series.\\n‚ÄúAn overwhelming majority of students will tell you that lecture is useless‚Äù \\nAnd an overwhelming majority of students struggle in CS70. As someone who went to essentially every lecture, I can assure you a large portion of students did not go at all, however the people that I know that did go (granted this is anecdotal), ended up doing well in the course. I would love to see data on this, and of course this is just speculation, but I guarantee there‚Äôs a positive correlation between lecture attendance and grades. \\n\\n‚ÄúI have spent approximately 900 hours‚Äù\\n\\nI‚Äôm sorry but this is just absurd. There just exists diminishing returns in studying and it simply does not make sense to be spending this much time. Not all studying is created equally, and I highly encourage you to reach out to peers that did well and see what their strategy is and adapt your study habits.\\n \\nThis one is two quotes \\n‚ÄúFor students who don‚Äôt have time to spare‚Äù \\n‚ÄúWhy offer a no-homework option‚Äù\\nYou critique CS70 through Tarang with past exams not including enough walkthroughs on the solutions. First off I think I agree with this philosophy of not just handing out the answers to students, and the person that convinced me was Professor Adikhari who designed Prob 140, and is an incredible professor. When you have difficult topics like Discrete Math and Probability Theory, all the learning comes through struggling and developing your own problem solving techniques. Seeing the answer just simply restricts your ability to learn. And I think the no-hw option exists purely for the reason of being accommodating. \\n\\n‚Äú61AB has a plethora of resources‚Äù\\n\\nI have to hard disagree with this. In office hours for CS61B it was extremely common for people to wait for 3 hours absolutely stuck on a bug, only to get 3 minutes with a TA that gave them the completely wrong advice. That simply doesn‚Äôt exist in CS70 where there isn‚Äôt the same existence of getting stuck on a bug, and there is always quick response times in office hours (legit the few times I went I was the only one haha).\\n\\nOverall, I think CS70 is difficult because 1) people do not take the proper prep courses to gain that ‚Äúmathematical maturity‚Äù (cringe term but true) and 2) because you just simply can‚Äôt half ass it like CS61 series where you can just spend a couple days grinding practice exams (61A) or projects (61B/C).

I wasn't afraid to take risks. My journey wasn't always an easy one and things weren't always awesome. I had down moments as well as up moments. Sometimes things were stressful and sometimes things were great. \\n\\nWith tech, the market is so hot that having some kind of background will open a door for you. And all you need to do is focus on getting better and not be afraid of a bit of adversity. Many of my peers at my FANG company are from great schools like Berkeley, Stanfurd and Caltech but many are also from school's not known for their CS program or don't have formal CS backgrounds at all. The ones who got on the perfect path seem to stand out but most people who reach success didn't have a straight line up.\",\n",

Recruiters see this and they will be impressed, regardless of major.  \\n\\nI\\'m a grad student in an unrelated discipline, but my spouse and I have a lot of friends here who have successful, rewarding, and high-paying jobs in tech, many of whom did not major in CS or a computer-related discipline at all.  Our most successful, high-paid friend works in computer security and manages a team of engineers.  He majored in business administration in undergrad at a just-fine state school with ok grades.  He loved programming and built up those skills on the side because at the time he didn\\'t know he would want to make it a career and business seemed more lucrative.  When he graduated, he decided to try his hand at programming jobs. He had to hustle a little bit in his first couple of years, but 12 years later, he is extremely successful, loves his job, and is contacted by recruiters all the time.  Another friend majored in ART, but always liked computers/digital stuff and he easily retrained with a few cc/extension courses and landed a really sweet job in front-end development/UX that pays him well and that he loves.\\n\\nMy point here is that many of you have been raised in a culture that is extremely competitive and cutthroat, and you are at BERKELEY, which is a very competitive place. (Many, many schools don\\'t require their undergrads to compete for spots within a major, that is unique to Berkeley.)  If you have passion for something and put in the work to develop skills, you will be able to find a job that you like, even if you didn\\'t major in it.  That goes for non-CS majors as well. Try to identify the skills you\\'re good at across your classes, and the types of professional tasks you like, talk to some of the coaches at the career center about how to write your resume to play up those skills, and then try to get some practical experience for a few years.\\n\\nSome of you will land super elite jobs right out of college, some of you will probably have to do a few years of grunt work (most people, even from ivies have to do this - some people by choice because they were miserable in their first \"elite\" career path and decided to start over), but please don\\'t make your self worth about whether your grades or major are elite enough.

I feel that a lot of Berkeley students feel that in order to thrive academically here, you have to be stressed as fuck around the clock, or else you will fall behind your classmates, not feel like you are living up to your true potential, etc.\\n\\nFrom my experience, this is not the case. I would actually argue that excessive stress makes you perform significantly worse than if you actively try to manage your anxiety and not let it hijack control of your reality. I had a similar situation last semester OP where I had to withdraw from Cal in October because of a relapse in OCD / depression onset by the stress of Berkeley. I was at the lowest point of my life, and I didn't think I would ever be able to escape the debilitating anxiety my mind seemed to force on itself. Since then, I've learned to manage my emotions through therapy better while also sticking with medication (at least for now); meditation has also been a huge help if you haven't tried it already.\\n\\nPlease, take care of yourself. You may think that the only way to succeed is through stress, but that's not true. If you're having a mini-stroke over Berkeley, you're doing something wrong.

       "   'My daughter got this email 2.5 hours ago:\\n\\nDear ‚Ä¶..,\\n\\nWe want to thank you for considering the University of California, Berkeley, and we want to reiterate our commitment to offering admission to as many talented students as possible from across California and beyond.\\n\\nA recent court decision, however, has the potential to significantly impact undergraduate admissions for the 2022-23 academic year and we want to make you aware of it.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Feb. 10, a California Court of Appeal ruled that UC Berkeley must follow a lower court‚Äôs order requiring the university to freeze student enrollment at the same level as 2020-21. To do so, our current estimate is that we would need to reduce our targeted fall 2022 new undergraduate student enrollment by at least 3,050 students. That in turn would mean reducing the number of offers of admission by at least 5,100.\\n\\nIn other words, at least 5,100 freshman and transfer students who would otherwise have been offered admission for fall 2022 would not receive such an offer. (In a typical year the campus offers admission to approximately 21,000 freshman and transfer students, and enrolls about 9,500 of them.)\\n\\nToday we filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of California as we feel the order was made in error. You can learn more about the court case and related enrollment concerns in a statement we posted today.\\n\\nWe want to assure you that we are pursuing every possible option for avoiding what would be a dire situation for prospective students and our campus. And, should we not succeed in our efforts to keep the enrollment freeze from being implemented, we will do everything in our power to mitigate the impacts on prospective students, and current members of the campus community. \\n\\nThis is unsettling news, we know. We recognize the amount of heart, energy, and intellect each student pours into their application, and today‚Äôs news is incredibly disappointing. Please continue to consider Berkeley as we challenge the court ruling and continue to fight for everyone one of these thousands of students who worked so hard for, and earned, a seat at UC Berkeley. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nAssociate vice chancellor of enrollment management and dean of undergraduate admissions\\nUniversity of California, Berkeley',\n",

Institutions have been using these tactics in attempts to sway public opinion for a long time. Whenever an institution is subject to protests or strikes they‚Äôll always find a way to cry to the public about how much money the evil protestors/strikers cost them, and because it seems like a lot of money, many people will support them. Institutions know this is a powerful tool so, in a quest to manipulate the public, they tend to place their hands on the scale. They do this in two main ways:\\n\\n1): they intentionally inflate the damages caused- institutions know that it‚Äôs make them look good to paint their opposition as destructive, and they know that more destructive the opposition seems, the better it makes them look. Institutions have a perverse incentive and they act on it by abandoning assets (leaving, probably insured, vehicles and property in the path of the protest and hoping for the worse), misclassifying other costs as damage ( such as labeling security costs, worker salaries, and sometimes lost productively as damages), and exaggerating loses (by representing minor vandalism or damage as the complete destruction of an asset and by neglecting to give net losses, which ,because most of the assets damaged will be insured, will be almost nothing)\\n\\n2): they give a false sense of the monetary implications- Institutions will just state an amount of damage. Some arbitrary huge dollar amount. That‚Äôs because they want you think of how that money relates to you, when in reality we should be thinking of how that amount relates to them, to their profit margin or operating budget. Let‚Äôs for example, assume that the protestors did cause Berkeley to eat a 1.5 million loss. That‚Äôs a lot of money for an individual, but it‚Äôs 0.05% of Berkeley‚Äôs 3 billion dollar operating budget. To put that in perspective, if you made 50k a year 0.05% of that would be $25 dollars.

Now at first this seems great, after all, this is a policy that completely ignores race, and therefore any other policy would be inherently racist, right?\\n\\nHere is the problem: Non White people in this country have historically been denied equality, and even after the 1960\\'s when race based legislation generally became illegal, inequality persisted. Let me provide an analogy. Suppose two people are about to run a race. One of them has 40 pounds of weights strapped to their legs while the other doesn\\'t. This race is obviously unfair. Let\\'s say that the race begins and once the unencumbered racer crosses the half way mark, the racer with the weights on their legs is allowed to drop the weights and run freely. Now the race is fair right? Of course it isn\\'t. I suppose at that very moment it might look that way, but the reality is that the racer who carried the weights is at a huge disadvantage because of the weights they had to bear before, even if they are gone now. Simply removing the weights is not enough to make the race fair.\\n\\nAnyways, the point is there is a lot of racialized wealth disparity in this country. [The average Native American household maintains just 8% of the wealth maintained by the average White household.](https://www.bushfoundation.org/racial-wealth-gaps-research-and-data) This is not a gap of a few percentage points, it is an ocean of difference. This is why policies like affirmative action and tuition remission for minorities are important, the people who benefit from them come from a people so severely disadvantaged by the system that must be remedied.',\n",

No bug salads, but just really bland... The chicken tenders last week tasted restauraunt quality, as if they were freshly made. This week, it tasted like something I'd find from the frozen section in safeway. The quality of the ingredients in general also tastes a bit offputting.

Opens up like twice (ok maybe 1.5x) the floor area for whatever you want. This could be a small couch, two dressers, a console for a TV, what have you. \\n\\nI'd recommend mapping this out on graph paper - get the dimensions of the room, and make each graph paper square 1 square foot in the room. Then trace out where a queen bed would go vs. bunk bed and see how much extra space you get and what could fit in that extra space. \\n\\nAt the end of the day, as everyone is saying, sharing a bed is only weird if either of you think it's weird. And what either of you think is weird is up to no one but yourselves. However, my tip is this: think of the worst night you ever had, where all you wanted was to just be in your bed by yourself without anyone disturbing you. If you share a bed with someone, you'll have to be ready for the possibility of having a night like this with someone sharing the bed with you - and vice-versa.

If there was a dorm, a coop house where female residents are victims of sexual violence (rape) and males are upset that they can\\'t visit or move there, that would be ludicrous. BTW, shelters for women of domestic violence where men are not allowed entry is quite common.\\n\\nSame goes for those who are Trans who want a space that isn\\'t anti-Trans and a shelter from those who aren\\'t Trans, because as students, they interact with Transphobia practically every day and want to return to their home with a peace of mind and no one who could potentially invade their space with re-traumatizing Transphobia.\\n\\nSo Black people aren\\'t excluded from the need to have protected spaces. I think White people called them \"reservations\" for indigenous First People\\'s - but never honored them by continually shrinking and mining them for resources. The difference is that those who are making disparaging comments are not Black, not fully aware of the Black experience, and don\\'t acknowledge or respect Black lives, our mental health, and need for protected spaces after experiencing multi generational slavery, exploitation, Jim Crow, systemic marginalization, economic disfranchisement, over-policing and rapid criminalization, fetishization, denial, erasure, Karen\\'s, Proud Boys, armed militias, and this generation\\'s four years of the Trump administration.

If you already had a criminal record with other felonies, you could try to shoot for a conviction under California's Three Strike Law, which might be a ticket to San Quentin.\\n\\nYour best bet might be to attempt armed robbery of a bank. This is unlikely to hurt anyone as bank tellers are trained how to deal with this situation professionally, and you are also unlikely to get away with it, if you are worried about the ethics of taking money from the bank. Also, the bank is insured for this kind of stuff anyway.\\n\\nHowever, one issue is that you risk getting shot, either by a security guard or a civilian who happens to be armed. I don't think this risk is extremely high in a social justice state like California, and it's less likely to happen if you act calm and professional, but it's still a risk.\\n\\nThe other issue is that you might get a long sentence for attempted robbery of a bank. In general, the kind of crimes that get you sent to San Quentin also carry long sentences. However, you might be able to take a plea deal for a shorter sentence, given you are a first-time offender. And you could also claim that it was a lapse of judgment brought on by your failing grades.\\n\\nWould you consider going to a federal prison rather than a state prison? There are a lot more non-violent crimes where the federal government will throw the book at you, than for state crimes.\\n\\nFor instance, computer crimes like hacking often carry very harsh federal criminal penalties. The guy who made the Silk Road, a dark web website for buying drugs, got a life sentence without the possibility of parole. That's harsher punishment than most murderers get, and just for creating a website.

My mom (and dad, RIP) scoured the city looking for somewhere that had comparable rent, and the majority of places were 1 or 2 bedroom apartments. You know what kept happening though? Landlords wouldn‚Äôt rent out to us because they intentionally set limits to how many people could live in the apartment to 2 people (which meant families would be excluded), in order to rent out to students (and jack up the rent a ridiculous amount).

If you are a DSP student you can get your own room for the same rate. They have a lot of vacancies rn due to covid.\\n\\n- work as a caregiver. A lot of families pay for live in nanny‚Äôs or caregivers at night (especially elderly folk). This way you get paid and it covers your expensive housing costs. \\n\\n- transfer to a school that you can afford in a city you can afford, get good grades and spend the big bucks on graduate school/med school/law school. Explain the financial burden of having to pay for your living expenses and why you had to transfer in your essay - and get good grades.',\n",

Hell, even the church in the olden days gave men permission to beat their wives bc women aren‚Äôt allowed to be sexual or something (which is a practice that still goes on today ‚Äî really goes to show how imbedded these ideals are in our society). Women were barred from having real jobs, moving up in the social and professional ladder, shunned if they even got divorced, and so on. Hell, even now women can‚Äôt get abortions bc some ppl think they can control our bodies. There are literal laws controlling what we can and cannot do with our bodies. So it makes sense why feminists would fight for what‚Äôs been wrong for centuries first then what has only been brought up in the past decade.\\nFact is, men have always had the leg up in society. \\nAnd before anyone comes for me, I KNOW a lot men also face their own issues and how society also places a lot of pressures and expectations on y‚Äôall. Men have it bad too, but historically, not as bad as women. \\nThat is not that say we shouldn‚Äôt advocate for men‚Äôs ‚Äúrights‚Äù.

Men shouldn‚Äôt need to feel like they must conform to society‚Äôs def of masculinity in order to feel/be attractive. Y‚Äôall deserve to live freely and comfortably too.\\nBut you have to ask why do these issues exist? Why and how did they start and why have they been continuing on to this day? The issues that men face were created by men and perpetuated by men and women (from internalized misogyny) from the past. (If you know your history, yes, most of these issues were created by men bc of what they thought was right ‚Äî usually rooted in religion ‚Äî and also women had little to not power so).

       "   'I can tell you where your money is not going - to your instructors.\\n\\nI am teaching a class with more than 200 students in that class.\\n\\nBy my estimate, the pro-rated pay for all the instructors in that class is (in terms of take-home pay) is about $120k, split VERY unevenly between the professor and the GSIs. Adjust that by about 25% up to account for the total the university has to spend on its staff (taxes, health insurance etc), and you get a nice number of $150k that is being paid by the university just for the teaching staff.\\n\\nNow, I can\\'t tell you EXACTLY which class this is, but if you use the 200 student number, each student is paying the staff $750 for the instruction.\\n\\nNow, if you are taking an average load of 16 units (which all of you should be taking to make the most of Berkeley btw), the average tuition (no fees, just tuition) with 15% non-resident students is around 8k.\\n\\nNow presumably the university gets some money from the government per student. Someone more knowledgeable about this should tell us whether that\\'s the case, but let\\'s roll with $8k as the cost of 16 units. This gives you a nice cost per unit of $2k for a 4 unit class.\\n\\nThis means that for big classes (which every single one of you will take, probably the majority of classes you will take), the university is passing less than 40% of your pro-rated tuition to your instructors. And this is disregarding any allowance that the govt gives for in-state tuition, which probably raises the money that is \"spent\" on tuition.\\n\\nIf you think the math is only broken for big classes, consider a 20 person 4 unit class taught by a post-doc with no GSI (postdocs make $60k a year with benefits). For one semester, that\\'s $30k in cost, or $37.5k with benefits and taxes etc. Divide by 20 and you get... less than $2k, by about 6%. But how many of these 20 person classes are you going to be taking in your time here?\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n1) Big classes subsidize small classes, except they don\\'t because tuition money more than covers the cost of instruction\\n\\n2) Your non-tenure track instructors (including GSIs) get absolutely obliterated by their low pay compared to the opportunity cost.\\n\\n3) And somehow the university still does not have enough money.\\n\\nSo yes, there is some mismanagement problem, but it is not just in the non-academic services that you are granted.',\n",

These funding cuts have been felt most strongly at the University of California, where funding per full-time-equivalent student fell from slightly more than $23,000 to about $8,000.\\n\\nThe UC has tried to make up that shortfall with tuition increases, but those can\\'t fully account for everything that it takes to run a university since there is still a state mandate for it to be \"public\" education and somewhat affordable (though I\\'d argue it really isn\\'t). This is doubly true if you consider modernizing your university, rather than just plodding along with the same buildings and systems you\\'ve been using since the 80s.

I was attending my dream school at one of the best private music conservatories and paying like $10,000 a year in student loans and making rent/food was nearly impossible for me. Long story short, I dropped out of school twice but came back the first time. I also got incredibly depressed and started doing poorly in class and didn‚Äôt even show up to some of my final exams because the financial stress/pressure from school was too much. I was SO discouraged with continuing my education because when I ultimately left I had a 2.65 GPA. I fixed it going to City College of San Francisco, which helped me get into Berkeley, but that‚Äôs another story.\\n\\nSometimes it‚Äôs helpful to take some time off and do something different but still productive. Whatever that means TO YOU. One thing that helped me (and I know most people would never think of doing this) is that I joined the Army Reserve. If you need money for school, it‚Äôs one of the best things you can do. Basically the commitment is 6 months to a year (or more depending on if you pick a particularly educationally based job like a linguist or military intelligence) of full time work. After that you do one weekend a month and two weeks full time during the summer. \\n\\nIf you have a lease in the Bay Area, you get a housing allowance for paying your lease. It‚Äôs the median cost of housing in the zip code your lease is in. For San Francisco/Berkeley, you would get $5,000/month on top of your Army salary, which would give you roughly $7,000/month for however long you‚Äôre doing your active duty training.\\n\\nOther incentives I got in my contract were:\\n\\n$50,000 Student Loan Repayment\\n\\n$1,000/month when enrolled in school full time (MGIB-SR + drill pay)\\n\\n$20,000 enlistment bonus\\n\\nThis is what allowed me to go from being totally broke with $20,000 in student loan debt to being able to go to school at Berkeley and live in San Francisco with a pretty decent standard of living. I understand not everybody is eligible to join the military nor is everyone willing to do it, but for me it was the best financial decision I‚Äôve ever made. \\n\\nAlso, since you‚Äôre out of state, you qualify for in state tuition in California if you have separated from active duty within 36 months. So even though I was a South Carolina resident when I got here, I get in state tuition at Berkeley. \\n\\nAnother option is to go active duty for three years and then you get the Post 9/11 GI Bill. You get free college at any public university plus a housing allowance (in SF/Berkeley it‚Äôs $5,000/month).\\n\\nI‚Äôm sorry what you‚Äôre going through, but do whatever you have to do to stay in school.

If a student is homeless or at risk of homelessness, they can qualify for being considered an independent student, rather than dependent. This means your parents get removed from your FAFSA and you become eligible for much more aid. The dependency appeal process takes documentation, and at Berkeley they require three letters of support and support documents. So if you qualify for in state tuition, I recommend going through this process at Berkeley and starting it as soon as you can. If you reach out to the Student Advocacy Office they can help you. If you‚Äôre not an in state student, then even if you‚Äôre an independent student at Berkeley, you‚Äôd still be paying the crazy out of state tuition, so it might be better to transfer to a school in your state where you‚Äôd receive more aid, and finish college there. I went through the dependency appeal process a few months ago, and this past semester I had an efc of 0 and got the majority of my tuition, rent, and bills covered. I would not have been able to attend school otherwise. Whatever college you go to will give you a lot more aid as an independent student, the tough part would be preparing the documentation and letters of supports, but that‚Äôs easier if you have someone official at a homeless shelter you‚Äôre staying at and friends to write a letter on your behalf.

If you have strong a mathematics maturity, such as be accustomed to formal proofs or  rationalizing some science stuffs in the past. It shouldn't be that bad. However, if you didn't, don't worry. Just try your best to read all notes before attending lectures. I could say if you could write out any proof in the notes. You are fine with this kind of abstract thinking.\\n2. Lectures cover material in very abstract ways, but the homework really helps you to get familiar with everything in depths. Personally speaking, I found lectures not quite helpful. It's basically reiteration of the notes, but sometimes oversimplifying the nuances of the beauty of this course. So, my suggestion is to spend more time on homework individually. It's completely a different experience from discussing them with classmates because sometimes on the exam you don't have that many collective ideas.\\n3. Exams in summer are much more friendly than in normal semesters. Just practice and train yourself to speed up. It's somehow different from homework because exams usually emphasize on the range of materials and therefore don't have many sophisticated thinking like homework do. Usually, 1 std + on midterm and final guarantees an A and the averages corresponds to B (or B+, a little bit unsure).\",\n",

       "   'Transcription of Daily Cal article by Professor Nicholas Weaver:\\n\\n>The following is my personal opinion. I do not speak for the EECS department, campus or anyone else.  \\n>  \\n>UC Berkeley\\'s electrical engineering and computer sciences department is trapped in a campus that underfunds undergraduate education but also demands that the department accommodate a huge growth in demand. Ten years ago, the department graduated roughly 400 students with Bachelor\\'s degrees in EECS or computer science. This year, the number will probably be 1400, or roughly 15%, of all undergraduates.  \\n>  \\n>A department that has privately tried to hold things together throughout a decade of unprecedented growth now lacks the funds to teach at scale and has to take unilateral action. Thus, for example, CS 70 (a class needed to declare Letters and Science CS), is almost certainly going to be limited to those who were admitted as intending to do CS starting in fall 2022.  \\n>  \\n>The fundamental problem starts with a campus that deliberately underfunds undergraduate education. The campus provides departments such as EECS with a budget of slightly more than $50 per student-credit per hour to pay for both lecturers and TAs. A student in a 4-unit class contributes roughly $200 out of the student\\'s overall tuition for these expenses. Yet the actual cost to a department is more than $350 per student for that 4-unit class, forcing departments to find additional funds to cover the upward of $150 per student gap.  \\n>  \\n>At this point the EECS department is running an annual deficit of nearly $5 million, and cutting this requires drastically cutting enrollment in CS classes. But the deficit is in many ways an excuse to do what needs to be done as no other major campus teaches at this seemingly impossible scale.  \\n>  \\n>We stumbled our way into handling the demand by scaling class resources using undergraduate TAs. We can maintain a pipeline of students who first take the class; then serve as a reader or tutor; then as a TA for multiple semesters. But this pipeline works only if a class is taught every semester.  \\n>  \\n>This technique has allowed classes, such as CS 161, CS 188, and other to each support more than 1,000 students a year.  \\n>  \\n>If we lose one of these classes for a single semester ‚Äî as might happen soon ‚Äî this disrupts the talent pipeline. Now the class changes from one that can support 1,000 students a year to one that can support perhaps 300 as the undergraduate talent pipeline evaporates. Losing just a single one of these scaled classes will be a disaster since the department must provide more than 7,000 student-seats per year in the upper division courses. It will create a situation where there are simply not enough classroom seats for our existing majors to meet graduation requirements.  \\n>  \\n>Repeatedly teaching the same class in order to maintain the pipeline is a recipe for faculty burnout and, without campus support, a thankless task. Dropping the student population by more than 50% would eliminate the need to maintain the teaching pipeline for so many classes, allowing the department to safely offer many of these classes only once a year rather than every semester.  \\n>  \\n>The department tried to convince Letters and Science to shift to a freshman admission model for CS in order to control the size of the major. Letters and Science rejected it. Thus it is highly likely that CS 70, a class necessary to declare the CS major, will be restricted starting in fall 2022 to only the students who actually listed CS or EECS as their intended major, cutting through the backdoor a major that Letters and Science refuses to allow the department to control earlier in the pipeline.  \\n>  \\n>And if this proposal is somehow circumvented or rejected by Letters and Science, it would be natural to restrict CS 70 to \"declared EECS and Letters and Science students only\" in 2023 ‚Äîand, since a student can\\'t declare in Letters and Science until they take CS 70 first, will kill the Letters and Science major entirely.  \\n>  \\n>The money is no doubt a concern. But even if campus would fund the department\\'s teaching (in the end it would cost less than $5million a year, or half of the stadium debt payments that campus took over from the athletic department), the department is still in danger of shattering just due to demand.  \\n>  \\n>In an ideal world, the EECS department would teach all those at UC Berkeley who want to pursue CS. But that would require explicit campus support ‚Äî not only a substantially higher amount of Temporary Academic Staff funding to eliminate the department\\'s deficit but also a willingness to provide more faculty slots to enable the EECS department to grow with the demand. As a department, our student/faculty ratio is three times worse than comparable institutions.  \\n>  \\n>Without this support, the number of students has to be drastically cut simply to avoid the even worse outcome of an upper division class failing.  \\n>  \\n>*Nicholas Weaver is a soon-to-be former lecturer in computer science at UC Berkeley.*\\n\\nEDIT: Apparently Reddit\\'s \"Fancy Pants Editor\" doesn\\'t work so good, and deleted part of the transcription.',\n",

Bravo to the OP!\\n\\nThere's a qualification I want to make, which didn't show up as saliently in the points made by the OP.\\n\\nFirst of all, the transmission rate, which is known to be higher than delta and others (as illustrated by it now being \\\\~95% of active cases in the US).

The very low numbers presented (1 in 10,000) are for hospitalization of the vaccinated.  We need also to be mindful that not everyone is is as fully protected (only 80% of Alameda county residents are fully vaccinated), and in person UC Berkeley students do pose some risk to them.\\n\\nThe second is that if someone tests positive, they need to stay home -- even if it just feels like a head cold.  A large number of simultaneous outages are not the end of the world, but they are having a noticeable effect elsewhere, like hospitals and airlines.

I sympathize with everything you said. The other option that some of us found other than being top graduates is to get into tech. Tech has been good over the past decade. But I think Berkeley on my resume has done very little for me. Tech usually does not care about academic institutions, just coding interviews and former employers.\\n\\nLA isn't that great for tech though. I was fortunate to stay in Bay Area after school and got pulled into the orbit. I also did IEOR, and transitioned slowly into tech from the sysadmin side. Note that IEOR and most engineering majors do not overlap at all with software, except EECS. I did a work study(?) job at Evans as a sys admin over the summer, and my first tech employer said that was what got me in. I shifted over to devops and software over the years.\\n\\nNone of it was planned. I wanted to get into management consulting but I recall it being very competitive and several companies at the career fairs were not even hiring or only accepting 1 out of every 300 candidates or something. It was only fortune that tech got bigger and bigger and the pays as well. That pulled almost everyone into its orbit in the entire region.

You have to really sacrifice for it, and not everyone wants to 180 their lifestyle for several months and risk even more financial burden if it doesn't pan out.\\n\\nso you are right, FUCK CAL. I do realize my degree was pretty worthless as well. Most of the lectures were boring AF and I learned way more on my own than listening to the research professors drone on b/c they didn't bother to show any enthusiasm for teaching. And I would have made a lot more money than I did if I just did a boot camp if those existing back then when I graduated. Just leetcode and get a job at Google or FB and I would be far richer. No college needed TBH. 4 years down the drain.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Skimmed through the rest of the thread. I think most people here are obviously still in school otherwise why be here. That means that their sentiment would probably more be focused on hope that their degree at Cal has worth, rather than it being more about the economy or tech. I do agree with those that say that your major might have had a significant factor. Engineering or science would have been better, and CS would have been GOLD.\"],\n",

Friends...or any relationship is a two-way street. You have to give in to it to get something out of it. \\n\\nYou have to be willing to talk about yourself. Willing to make that time for people. Willing to be courageous enough to show your true side. You'll be amazed at the response you get. If you don't get that response, then it's ok, you'll vibe with someone else. You may also give in more than you get back, and that is ok too(as long as it doesn't affect your main focus - school).  \\n\\nNow - the easiest way to make friends is to connect with someone based on common likes/hobbies/dislikes/whatever. You have to put yourself out there when you're out in the world. For example, When you go to class - say hi to the person next to you every day. Know their name and ask how they are... put some energy in that. \\n\\nIf you do you HW alone, just ask someone from class and make some time to do HW together and ask questions if you need help. So what if you get turned down... just ask. Maybe instead of them meeting you alone, you'll be invited to a group. Magic happens when you ask. \\n\\nGo to the library, and its smarter to go to the library where you know there are students that are in your classes. This way - its not weird if you approach them to ask a questions, and get an in.  \\n\\nWhat ever it is - try to do it in a genuine way. If you are shy, you dont need to really talk about a lot. Just need to ask a question, listen, and then add something that progresses the conversation, rinse and repeat. \\n\\nIf you're a wallflower - maybe it might be a smarter idea to make a friend is a high energy person, this way when you both hit up groups, he can attract all the talking etc, while you still get to be part of the group and you can open up to other wall flowers or other people. Get that confidence up. \\n\\nI went off kilter there, but thats only because of what you wrote. You shared and were vulnerable. You are quite capable of making friends. \\n\\nSo then to answer your question - is it you? it is...and it isnt. It is in the sense that you need to make the effort. It isnt, in the sense that you're not some cursed being thats unable to make friends.\\n\\nIm rooting for you homie. :)\",\n",

Sport may not be your thing and that's okay, but if you think it might be, give it a shot. Top tip: the more esoteric sports may well have the more accepting and less overwhelming communities. I played squash and despite being absolutely crap I ended up representing Cal on tour for a brief moment which was an incredible experience.\\n2. Non-profits / altruistic clubs. For example I spent some time working with a club that helped tutor underprivileged Asian elementary kids in downtown Oakland. I'm not Asian. It was AWESOME. My buddies did Suitcase Clinic and that defined their lives in many ways. \\n3. Coffee shops. It's probably different now with everyone absorbed in their laptop but I have always found studying in coffee shops led to chance encounters with kindred spirits that can't happen in the library or at home. This trend has continued long beyond college for me.\\n4. New roommates? I am not sure what your living situation is but a reshuffle there might introduce new options for your social life. It's a gamble though so I might exhaust the other options first if your living situation is stable.\",\n",

Before college I always thought of myself as a relatively outgoing, social person but there was something about the culture of Berkeley that was extremely isolating and made making real friends difficult for me. Once I broadened my search to outside of students, I instantly found a whole bunch of people I vibed with a lot harder. Maybe it was the people themselves - Cal generally does attract a certain kind of person and I don‚Äôt often get along with the stereotypical overachievers. But I think more than that, it was the fact that non-students actual had a life and personality, whereas Cal kind of requires people to temporarily give up a lot of their time and soul just to survive. Then when Cal students have rare opportunities for a break, often all anyone has to talk about is school or school-adjacent hobbies, and as a result any ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù from the stress just serve as reminders of the things you aren‚Äôt doing that you need to do, or a reminder of ways your peers are better than you, or a weird pissing contest about who has the hardest schedule/life/whatever. Branching outside the bubble of Cal students for social interaction was one of the best decisions I ever made in school for my mental health.\\n\\nDepending on what you‚Äôre into, try to find a cool hobby or club that has nothing to do with the school! For me, it was getting into video/film and indie music, so I found the best friends of my life in the DIY/Indie/Underground Music & Art scenes of the bay. For you it could be a sport, or theater, or political activism, or cooking or one of a million other things you‚Äôre already into.

Ultimately if we want the economy to recover well, it won‚Äôt be because we move to a fully service oriented economy but because our manufacturers and other industries become more competitive.\\n\\nAs athletics and other traditional methods of funding wane, a massive college of ‚Äúdata‚Äù is a good way to grow the school. The college of engineering is too limited by having to provide quality, intensive education in niche fields w/less than 100 people, and L&S is better oriented to offering breadth, such that a college of data could feasibly try to have thousands of students while emphasizing developed online resources and utilizing land around the east bay to reduce the student housing/affordability crisis. Pouring money into a new college and then filling it with 1000s of majors still seems cheaper to me than funding administration in CoE/L&S. \\n\\nAn ABET unaccredited data science major will likely save money in overall administration while not costing jobs at the vast majority of places looking for data analysts or software engineers.\\n\\nUltimately EECS is a great major, but we are wasting a lot of time and money under the funding crisis by trying to compete for professors/classes/research with every other college when we could expand out the principles of data science into a full college with sub-specialities that would satisfy 90% of the students in a CS class right now. That way, EECS could remain at its current size and still have quality classes and opportunities without suffering so much of a funding issue for great, relevant courses on the EE side (though realistically this announcement means some CS upper divs like 168 or 172 will likely be offered less as those professors are asked instead to reach thousand person data and networks classes).\\n\\nHowever my hot take is that there are more students looking for EE intensive curriculum and not getting it than those who are underserved in the cs material that will be cut, just because the 5th year ms, tons of research labs and other opportunities around campus still help those students compete at the highest level internationally.',\n",

I don‚Äôt practice in your state, so it may be slightly different where you live, but typically it is *not* a good idea to withhold rent from your landlord. The attorney can send a letter via certified mail and your Landlord will have a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue. You should write down any other maintenance issues and have him include those in the letter, too. The more serious the problem, the less time the landlord will have to fix it. If he doesn‚Äôt fix it, you should be able to break your lease. \\n\\nRegarding your deposit: you shouldn‚Äôt normally be liable for anything that is considered normal wear and tear. This means they can‚Äôt charge you for cleaning or renovations or maintenance. Landlords routinely abuse tenants by taking deposits they aren‚Äôt legally entitled to.  \\n\\nSorry you have a shitty landlord. Again, the rules might be slightly different where you live, but this is what‚Äôs normal most places. A lawyer can solve all of these things quickly and easily. In my state, lawyers get their time and you get triple damages for taking on cases like this. Good luck and merry Christmas!\\n\\nEdit: you can (in my state) hire someone to do reasonable repairs and deduct that from your next rent. I think that is more risky than getting an attorney involved at the beginning, but if you try that, I would advise asking your landlord in writing to fix it, then make sure to document everything related to the repair. Photograph/video the problem, get a description of the repair and a receipt for parts/labor in writing.

       "   'Posting my original reply as a standalone comment here: \\n\\nHey, no longer a Berkeley student, but an alumnus whose SO is an ICU nurse who‚Äôs been dealing with tons of death for the past ~2 years. A couple thoughts:\\n\\n1) You seem to either believe or are trying to imply to us that Omicron is the only dominant variant in circulation. The reality is we don‚Äôt know for certain what percentage of Covid patients, even ICU patients, are Omicron vs other variants. It‚Äôs not like a switch flipped and the virus suddenly said, ‚Äúonly omicron can infect people now.‚Äù Variants can circulate in tandem with one another.\\n\\n2) My partner‚Äôs hospital (a level one trauma center in the mid Atlantic US) has more patients dying right now from Covid than *any other time* in the pandemic. The broader data supports this too. Moreover, a major city level one trauma center doesn‚Äôt have the capacity to test each patient for omicron vs other variants; instead, they randomly sample some patients and extrapolate the data in the labs. The guidance the ICU staff recently received from the attending physician was that ‚Äúwe simply don‚Äôt know enough how this is going to play out to take any risks.‚Äù \\n\\n3) Students never really have been the center of concern of any Covid variant in terms of risks to their health, but young people are extremely high risk for exacerbating the spread of the virus and ultimately, more variants. This ultimately translates to more at risk people dying because of a would-be surge of Covid rates if option 2 were selected. \\n\\n4) That said, younger people can still get very sick from the virus. Anecdotally, my partner had a 27 year old patient with no medical history receive a double lung transplant because Covid destroyed his lungs.  Yes, Covid (if unvaccinated) is still much deadlier than the flu. Yes, if you‚Äôre vaccinated, Covid is about as deadly as the flu. Omicron is less deadly than classical covid, but allowing a Cambrian explosion in the number of covid patients is nothing short of reckless. \\n\\n5) You‚Äôre spot on in pointing out that Omicron has more virality and risk of spreading. This doesn‚Äôt mean that healthcare workers are magically immune to the higher infection risk too. Currently, my SO‚Äôs ICU has 20 out of their 29 ICU beds as covid patients, and she had 5 coworkers (physicians and nurses) call out of work this week because they all were infected. Because of that, the nurses and physicians working in the unit had to pick up 4-5 12 hour shifts in one week to cover the lack of staffing due to infected healthcare workers. Not only is this unsustainable, but your suggestion that ‚Äúletting er rip‚Äù will handicap the healthcare system‚Äôs ability to treat people who actually need serious medical care because of covid. \\n\\nWith all due respect, please show some deference to the people who actually have to deal with this virus in a serious way other than professional or academic inconveniences. I‚Äôm tired of death, I‚Äôm tired of having to help my partner get through clinically diagnosed PTSD because of the number of people she‚Äôs seen die, or panic about dying while in an ICU bed because they refused to get vaccinated and now wished they were vaccinated.',\n",

We just have to keep moving forward in our lives and make due with the situation we‚Äôre in.\\n\\nCOVID was scary at the beginning of the pandemic because we didn‚Äôt know much about it and we had no idea how bad it could get. However, now we know enough about the virus and how to treat it, and we have sufficient protections via vaccines that we should all move on with our lives. \\n\\nThe vast majority of us don‚Äôt live with someone who is truly immunocompromised.

       "  ['I‚Äôve experienced this since high school. In middle school, it was less common for some reason, but people tended to drift toward their own race once 8th grade was over. I remember having a Korean best friend in middle school and he ended up in a Korean group, which were full of very nice people that I got along with, but I just didn‚Äôt feel like I belonged. I ended up transferring high schools mainly because of the fact that I was the only Bangladeshi student in a predominantly white school with cliques that usually formed around race. I understand it though. Those people have much more in common culturally, so it makes sense for them to make a small group for each other to remind the members of home. It sucks, but it‚Äôs just reality. \\n\\nI have another Bengali buddy who went to CSUN and surprisingly ended up in a Vietnamese club, which he enjoyed a lot. He still goes to their events and keeps in touch with many people from that group. This lead to me conclude that it really depends on how outgoing you are. You don‚Äôt necessarily have to be of the same race to feel included in any racial group. You just have to be persistent in making the effort to be friends with them. This includes being interested in and curious of different cultures and their lifestyles. I wish I did that in high school instead of transferring but oh well. You live you learn.\\n\\nEdit: Ironically, I went to one the the first BSA (Bangali Student Association) meetings here at Berkeley last Fall and I did not feel like I belonged because I‚Äôm not much of an enthusiast or a nationalist when it comes to my own country of origin lololol.',\n",

It‚Äôs not right, but it‚Äôs just the way things are. To combat this, there‚Äôs a lot of student associations and clubs which you can join if you do ever feel alienated.

       "   'Yes but not for the usual reasons. I really hate being called or thought of as a \"PoC\" because I absolutely hate thinking about my skin color, let alone having others bring it up. The way race and diversity is hammered out in more political discussions makes me super uncomfortable where the term PoC just seems to be used to make us into some super weak group lacking any power and needing pity. I can often at least discuss this with other minorities and I know I\\'m not alone in feeling this way but it gets especially uncomfortable trying to relay this to politically active White people who take offense to not liking more Progressive language or frameworks. At times the \"we need to empower more PoC, WoC and marginalized communities\" feels more like people say it because it\\'s what\\'s socially acceptable than because it\\'s actually anything profound or particularly applicable to the situation and that makes me feel weird.\\n\\nAs others note though, it\\'s not entirely untrue either that a lot of campus social life and organizations are predominantly led by and focused on Asian issues and people do tend to \"naturally\" segregate by race. It\\'s enough I notice but I\\'ve felt comfortable enough to overcome it. I don\\'t think people for the most part mean to be malicious or conscious about it and confidence goes a long way in breaking past these barriers. I\\'ll also note that I don\\'t think a lot of our groups for minorities help the issue much. They\\'re extremely insular spaces that don\\'t really do much to connect with the campus in general so I came around to viewing them as isolating traps. Good in small bursts but too easy to fall into its own racialized cliques if you aren\\'t careful.\\n\\nOne last observation is that while I wouldn\\'t say I feel this way in general for campus, I absolutely feel it when it comes to Greek Life and social status. What I mean is this: people think fraternities and sororities only recruit rich White people because they\\'re racist without realizing how much of the campus itself views the fraternities and sororities with more diverse brothers or sisters as being inferior. That is, the social system doesn\\'t exist in isolation but is directly shaped and built by the prejudices of the campus itself. Internal discussions within these organizations often have to worry about racial quotas *because* judgment by those outside of Greek life looks down on places deemed too diverse. I can\\'t tell you how many people I see who are actively saying the \"right things\" are often the ones most flattered and seeking validation from the mostly White sororities or fraternities. It\\'s a bit disheartening and it\\'s not helpful when it\\'s treated as an issue peculiar to Greek life. I\\'m thankful I found a fraternity that didn\\'t really emphasize race and allowed itself to be diverse but it\\'d be a lie to say it didn\\'t affect our social perception. \\n\\nFor this last point, I wouldn\\'t say it made me feel isolated so much as made me realize how empty a lot of the rhetoric and sentiments in Berkeley are.

This guy scammed me a bit differently (there are variations in this scam which I assume they change the story accordingly after feeling out the person to have the highest chance of the getting some $ from the victim). So this person gave me fake cologne claiming it was a gift since he couldn't take them back. (He probably try to sell it to other victims) Then goes on telling me about how he needed to cover expense like gas, rental cars, luggage, etc because of some bs about time zone difference in Italy. He promise he would pay me back by midnight. Unfortunately I fell for it. These people will be a fast talker, intimidating,  but also try to get the person's sympathy by being nice about it. I feel the sympathy part is how they get people to hand them money. But it's all a scam and they play this over and over again on different people.\\n\\nGoing forward I will be more careful when it comes to stranger. Also remember that you don't owe anyone anything like your time, an explanation, etc. So if there are strangers trying to get your attention, you can choose to ingore them if you feel suspicious. Or if you want to help them, exercise caution and be in control of the situation. Once they start telling story, generally it's a scam and it's time to go, no need to stick around. No need to feel rude about it. Especially cases like this where they start off with a seemingly simple question, it can escalate into a full blown story really fast. There's a reason they don't start off by asking for money like most common panhandler, because our first reaction is to say no.\",\n",

It'll probably help calm peoples nerves, and it would hopefully allow the school to make more informed decisions going forward. The biggest change I see us needing is testing requirements. I'm vaccinated and live off campus, so I only have to get tested once every 90 days. If we get accurate testing numbers on the student body, then hopefully it'd be easier to make a correct decision going forward.

However, it's definitely been left to rot and gone downhill for a while now.\\n\\nI was at the 50th anniversary a few years back and met a lot of people who genuinely wanted to keep the spirit of the park alive, and I agree with that, but part of the issue was nobody was willing to police it. The city and university wanted it dead to develop, and the people weren't able to keep crime out on their own.\\n\\nIMO there has to be some kind of monument to the movement, but it was just that, a movement. As the movement died down, the park died with it, and what's been left is a husk of what once was, unable to be enjoyed by most students and community members.\\n\\nThere are still some folks who are hardline against change there, and they're going to take some convincing. Some will never be convinced. But the city/uni will win. It's inevitable at this point: Public opinion is on their side.\\n\\nIt was a beautiful thing while it lasted, but its time is up.\\n\\nThat said, there should definitely be some prominent monument to the free speech and anti-war movement in Berkeley.

Housing, however, will still be ungodly expensive.\",\n",
       "   'From what I\\'ve heard, the main issue is that pro-park peeps don\\'t agree with the University\\'s \"two birds one stone\" approach of removing peoples park and building housing at the same time.\\n\\nEssentially, protestors believe that there are other places in Berkeley/around campus that housing can be built, and that it need not necessarily be right there. At the same time, they view this construction plan as a mask to cover the school\\'s true desires to remove the homeless population, and student housing is just a convenient excuse. Dissatisfaction with the measures and resources extended to the folks currently living on the park also plays a part.\\n\\nThe power that the university hold to \"evict\" residents is another thing that protestors do not like, and see this as an abuse of power by the school. Basically comes down to how you view the homeless. If this is their home, then the university is forcefully kicking people out against their wishes. If you see the homeless as squatters on University land, then this is right and lawful, and probably overdue.\\n\\nNuanced topic, which is not helped by trolls and jokes and loud virtue signaling by anybody',\n",

I'll give them that. They're guided with a lot of emotion, particularly anger, which has lead to them being destructive. They feel they're being humanitarian, but the only thing they're helping is the cycle of homelessness, leaving the homeless trapped in the same position, and an unclean and dangerous society (littered trash, and mentally unstable/intoxicated homeless people who aren't getting the help they need).\",\n",

       "   \"The main reason people are supporting people's park is because it serves two purposes: the first being a belief that the homeless there are getting wronged, and the second being a homage to the 60's berkeley zeitgeist of protesting where Mario Savio did during the free speech movement in a performative bastardization of it.  With all things, it's rooted in personal gain, either in the form of feel-good theatrics or social justice clout for further leveraging of their positions as defenders of the marginalized.  Objectively, building on people's park provides a mediated solution that attempts to appease every side.  The project features housing for students, low income housing, and space for the park with a memorial to its history.  It sucks that the homeless are getting displaced, but it was a dangerous area that really wasn't safe for them either.\",\n",

Others have already provided words of encouragement, but I want to specifically address the socioeconomic aspect of your post...\\n\\nComing from a low-income family, it\\'s really easy to internalize substantial pressure without even realizing it. Anything ranging from \"I have to blaze this trail for my younger siblings\" to \"my parents worked so hard to get me here, I have to make their sacrifices worthwhile\" to \"it\\'s not fair that I have these opportunities when my friends/relatives didn\\'t\". This pressure and guilt takes a cumulative psychological toll, and represents an invisible burden that many affluent students simply don\\'t experience. Even worse, these emotions sharpen every perceived failure: you\\'re not just disappointing yourself, you\\'re letting down your family or not honoring their sacrifices.\\n\\nAmidst all of this stress, I want to urge you to think about it from their perspective. Regardless of how you perform, your very presence at Cal ‚Äî an elite school, home to many students from privileged backgrounds ‚Äî speaks not only to the fruits of their sacrifice, but also your tenacity and hard work. And _that\\'s_ why they\\'re proud of you, deep down, even if they say or think differently in the moment. It\\'s been a rough semester, and coming from poverty makes everything harder. You said it yourself: you worked really hard. Their faith in you represents their pride at what you\\'ve _already_ been able to achieve, and the perseverance you\\'ve _already_ demonstrated. It\\'s a gift that recognizes their pride in who you already are; it\\'s not a strings-attached loan predicated off hypothetical future accomplishments. To the extent that their gift says anything about the future, it\\'s that they have faith that you and your hard work will be enough, as a whole person. And you will make them proud just by continuing to do your best, defying the odds in an elite environment.\\n\\nI know it sucks royally to not get the results you worked so hard for. Especially when you\\'re surrounded by competitive, brilliant peers, many of whom have had more opportunities or fewer external stressors. But try not to let this disappointment extend to guilt over this gift. Cherish the bracelet as a reminder of their love and sacrifice, and let it give you strength to keep pushing through the inevitable toll of semesters to come. If you were just dicking around, that would be one thing...but you\\'re at Cal, and you\\'re trying your best, and your family wants to show you how proud they are.

       "   '\"According to the claim, UC Berkeley has ‚Äúoverenrolled‚Äù its school by up to 30 percent over the last decade without first seeking approvals from its neighbors, which the judge ruled should have happened under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The lawsuit says that the environment ‚Äî their environment? ‚Äî is being ruined by the presence of too many students, who are overcrowding apartments, burdening local emergency services, and creating too much noise and trash. Since the claim was first filed, the university has agreed to pay more for municipal services and released a 15-year long-range plan for ‚Äúresponsible, flexible, and sustainable development‚Äù to address its growing enrollment ‚Äî including 11,700 new beds over the next two decades. But the court ruling puts that vision on hold and, like the enrollment freeze, will require an intervention from the California Supreme Court to overturn it.\\n\\nThe suit was brought by Save Berkeley‚Äôs Neighborhoods, a group of neighbors with a long history of litigation against the university that‚Äôs headed by Berkeley resident Phil Bokovoy, a lawyer who is also closely affiliated with three other homeowners associations. Bokovoy first moved to the city‚Äôs Elmwood neighborhood, a few blocks from campus, to attend graduate school there. But what was apparently once good for him shouldn‚Äôt be an option for students now. **‚ÄúWhen I moved into my house, there were 27,000 students. Now it has 45,000 students. I didn‚Äôt choose to live in a town with 45,000 students,‚Äù** he told NBC Bay Area. Bokovoy says that he wants UC Berkeley to build a new satellite campus in Richmond, five miles away. (The university briefly wanted the same but abandoned the plan.) If not, Berkeley proper will be overwhelmed by students, Bokovoy told Slate last year. **‚ÄúWe‚Äôll end up like Bangkok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur ‚Äî dense Asian cities where there‚Äôs no transportation network.‚Äù** Not only is his view of these cities incredibly outdated ‚Äî Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur have extensive public-transit systems ‚Äî but it also feels like he‚Äôs specifically referencing the demographics of Berkeley‚Äôs student body, which is 40 percent Asian.\\n\\nThe lawsuit is a stark example of how CEQA is used to stop development altogether instead of actually mitigating its negative effects. ‚ÄúCEQA treats population growth as a big problem, whether or not it‚Äôs occurring exactly where it should be occurring from an environmental perspective,‚Äù says Chris Elmendorf, a law professor at the University of California, Davis. Adding more students to a dense urban area is what more California cities like Berkeley should be doing to lower greenhouse-gas emissions and wildfire risks, he says. ‚ÄúIt will probably create more noise in certain neighborhoods, and there may be more beer cans ‚Äî these are college students ‚Äî but so what in the great scheme of things?‚Äù\\n\\n**If Bokovoy was indeed concerned about housing or transportation impacts, his group would be encouraging UC Berkeley to locate more housing near the school, allowing more students (and faculty) to live in closer proximity to their classes. (In fact, his groups have brought lawsuits against those plans, too.)** Dan Zack, an urban planner in Fresno whose daughter had applied to UC Berkeley and received a letter about the potential enrollment cap this week, worries that pushing thousands of students out of Berkeley means more of them will end up in schools in auto-dependent areas. **‚ÄúThis will put an additional financial burden on them because they‚Äôll have to own and operate a car,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd will almost certainly be a net loss for the environment.‚Äù**',\n",

It condenses years of math maturity and proof experience inside... 14 weeks. It is 4 classes in 1, neither of which is given enough time to grow into the minds of students. The easiest way to resolve the issues is to split the course into a 2 semester sequence that actually takes the time to teach you how to do proofs and why proofs matter in CS.\\n\\nAlso take out the probability module. I understand that it has bearing on other classes in CS, but... there are dedicated classes that teach you the material properly in the departments that teach these things for a living (stats, math).\\n\\nThat said, I also disagree with OP\\'s take on the \"skewed hiring practices\" - mathematics is mostly about imitating the proofs and solutions of other people until you get it. The pool of people who \"get math\" to the level that it is required in the CS70 curriculum is already small enough - would you rather be imitating someone who \"gets it\" or who \"doesn\\'t get it\"? Or is the claim that there are other capable potential staff who get looked over?',\n",
       "  \"Former CS70 GSI here.\\n\\nThese are all superficial problems. The real problem with CS70 is that it's a monstrosity spawned by intra-departmental politics.\\n\\nThey are trying to cram too much material because there are conflicting requirements from the EE and CS sides, but the EE v CS rivalry does not allow them to remove material so that what remains can be taught properly. They are also trying to make it ‚Äúsexy‚Äù by teaching advanced topics like RSA, error-correcting codes, and linear regression.\\n\\nConventionally, math is taught by first providing a bit of motivation for a concept, then the concept is given a rigorous definition, then simple claims are proven, then its properties are explored, and finally some proof of a minor or major theorem is given. The proofs are often chosen to illustrate new mathematical techniques. \\n\\nIn CS70, there's some motivation but concepts are not defined with rigor, there's no time, so simple properties are not explored, not shown and not proven, and we jump directly to some proofs that students are not equipped to understand.  Students are in a constant mathematical haze.\\n\\nFor example, to teach error correcting codes and secret sharing, you must first teach polynomials over finite fields. But CS70 does not even define what a field is, and finite fields are given a single lecture slide and a bit more than single page in the notes. \\n\\nI can give many other examples.\\n\\nThis is supposed to be the first course where students are exposed to proofs and mathematical rigor, but there's simply no time for that and the course fails in its most important mission.\\n\\nThere is no textbook. The reason is simple, no one else is crazy enough to cram all this material into a single course. The notes are no substitute. They are a mess.\\n\\nThe massive use of UGSI is a big problem. They are very smart and motivated, but they often don‚Äôt have the mathematical maturity or perspective to teach this kind of course, especially the second year ones.\\n\\nAnd finally, if the department wants to require the student to work for the equivalent of an 8 unit course, it should be honest and list CS70 as an 8 unit course, not force students to give up other courses and any resemblance of social life. University regulations are there for a reason, y'all should file official complaints against the department.\\n\\nOn the positive side, at least it is not as bad as EE16B.\",\n",

Imagine me, a cognitive science major (and creative writing minor), having to take this class as a major requirement without mathematical maturity or interest to be honest. \\n\\nI had to choose the no-homework option. There was absolutely no way I was actually capable to do the problems in the homework‚ÄîI didn't even know how to start, or enough material to even attempt. \\n\\nFurthermore, as a social learner (as opposed to a textbook learner), I attended every lecture and discussion. However, lectures were disorganized and rushed, slides were not engaging and a mess as well. I learned more from 5 minutes from my discussion review lecture than 1.5 hours of Sen's or Rao's lectures‚Äîgenuinely the biggest waste of my time. Especially Professor Sen, he was just inarticulate and mumbled in speech, disorganized in his thoughts and logic flow, and unfamiliar with his slides.\\n\\nLastly, reading through the post and comments, I liked the author's point of feeling looked down upon to ask questions because it was the case for me. As a straight-A student (except for my B+ in Math 54), I have never felt more dumb and lost. I was confused about the most basic concepts and after attempting to ask about my confusion a few times in a discussion class where it seemed like everyone else was understanding, I stopped trying to ask or answer questions by my UGSI (I felt like a fool having never answered a question asked by my UGSI right).  Another person in the comments were using the example of finite fields‚ÄîI still don't know what they are‚Äîto say how fundamental concepts were not introduced that were built upon for the actual material in this class. I went to Professor Rao's office hours and it was the most condescending and unhelpful staff interaction I have had in Berkeley; I went to him with a list of conceptual, basic questions to ask but he didn't bother to listen to what I was confused about and started going on long tangents and told me I had to read the notes (and started reading the notes with me). I was actually speechless and felt helpless after the interaction. \\n\\nThis semester, I went from Developmental Psychology to this class, which has been so irrelevant compared to all the other courses I have taken for the major (everyone I've talked to, including seniors who graduated, was confused why this was a cogsci req).  All this to say, I want to shout out all the people who took this class out of requirement but the subject matter was outside of their usual academic interest and expertise. I got around 1 standard deviation below the class mean for the final and most of it was by test-taking strategies more than the actual hours of review I put in.

       "  \"I think you bring up a lot of good points, but the teaching issues are harder to fix than you realize. I got an A+ in the class and was a reader for a semester of 70, but the honest truth is I still didn't understand like half the material in the class well enough to walk someone else through it in depth - most of how I solved problems was just intuitive leaps that I couldn't fully explain to another person. (part of this might be that I'm not the greatest teacher, but I still believe what you can teach is a strict subset of what you yourself understand.)\\n\\ncs70 is a very, very difficult class conceptually speaking. there are a literal handful of people per semester who genuinely understand the material inside-out, to a point where they can teach it effectively. these are usually the people who've been doing competitive math for 10+ years and made USAMO. my experience has been that these people (as opposed to people that just dabbled in competitive math - making aime 2-3x will help you ace cs70 but isn't really impressive on the same level) are usually the best TAs. using grades isn't the best metric, but I understand why they do it for 70.\\n\\nI think this class would heavily benefit from GSIs with a lot more experience, since almost no undergrads are actually qualified to teach this class.

       "  \"i really and truly appreciate when course staff/tutors/folks involved with the course share things like this. i was a nontraditional/reentry student and CS was nonexistent in my high school and none of the community college courses i took articulated to berkeley, nor were they remotely as ~rigorous as the 61 series/70 expects. i felt awful trying to navigate these classes and my TAs definitely tried their best but there was always a vibe of 'yeah it's hard but there's nothing wrong with the course, keep trying and you'll get there' when in reality it was apparent that students with prior experience in competitive math or programming or who had been exposed to this kind of material before coming in had a huge advantage and when that seems to be an ever increasing proportion of the student body as optimizing your college app and experiences skew more getting towards programming experience as EECS/CS continues to be an incredibly selective major in an already selective school, the expectation becomes that you're already familiar with the course material and the tests become an exercise in pattern matching or gotchas since the content is already known to the majority of the class and the exam scores 'curving' to some average or bin shifting reflect that. \\n\\nidk im rambling but thank you OP for expressing this so well\",\n",
       "  \"I come from a rigorous math/cs background and also have friends with a similar background and I have to agree with the vast majority of what you said. Prior experience makes 70 along with a whole plethora of classes significantly easier. I also agree with the premise that there are many things the course staff could do significantly better about the presentation of the material. Certainly there are going to be discrepancies no matter how good the teaching is, but it should be the goal of the course staff to bring everyone up.\\n\\nI do think however that it is a bit of a stretch to say that the course staff is making content artificially harder. I don't think neither the professors or the TAs have such malicious designs, and the course policy instead stems from a difference in teaching philosophy. I want to preface by saying that I feel their teaching philosophy is not necessarily wrong, but it does mean there are some significant consequences.\\n\\nFirst, for context, I want to elaborate exactly why previous experience helps. While there is some effect of learning the same content before, that's not all of it. I have a comp math background, but I didn't know about a significant amount of course material (70%). The 30% I knew is a good chunk, but I think an even bigger factor is the level of mathematical maturity that comes from that previous experience. Making intuitive leap of faiths is a natural extension of that experience, and I think that is exactly what the professors are trying to nurture. I don't completely agree with the policy, but I think skipping a bit of the proof such that you have to fill in the gaps is one way to encourage such growth. It's a pretty common method, especially in math.\\n\\nUltimately, the material itself is only a part of what you are supposed to learn. There's definitely a lot of other things (dealing with notation, intuition, problem-solving persistence) that the course is trying to 'teach' on top of the actual course material that are arguably more important. At the very least, that's the impression I get from prof. Rao's mini-rants during lectures. However, it is empirically extremely difficult to develop these skills, even on a 1-on-1 basis. Imagine how hard it is to do at such a massive scale. For better or for worse, CS 70 as it is today is a compromise -- it accepts that some people may not follow (due to inadequate resources), but I believe it at least attempts to maximize the amount that does and get as much as the core skills out of the class.\\n\\nI will end this part by mentioning that I know people who do not have extensive math backgrounds, but have gained significant mathematical maturity during their time at Berkeley. There's also a lot of privileged people who have tried to get into comp math and couldn't. This is to say that privilege certainly has a part in accruing opportunities before college, but at the same time it isn't perfectly clear cut. I believe most are well aware of this, but I think it's important to say nonetheless. While 70 might feel and legitimately be unfair, it's also the class where all those inequalities come to light out of necessity. I'll go further by saying that it has potential to be the class that closes the gap and level the playing field, so to speak. I certainly think closing that gap is part of why Berkeley exists.\\n\\nGiven these thoughts, I have a slightly different conclusion in diagnosing the problems and a set of solutions that will most likely never happen. The main problem is that 70, as a requirement to declare the major, takes the majority of the responsibility to impart mathematical maturity to CS students. One class is not enough, yet it's important that it is a prereq because many upper div classes will require sufficient mathematical maturity not to mention the course material in this class. In an ideal world, I would split 70 into two classes, 70A, 70B, and an accelerated honors class H70 like in a lot of math classes. First would be geared more towards mathematical understanding, the second towards the more specific parts of 70. Splitting 70 would give the needed time to digest the content and develop necessary skills. Anecdotally, one of the best ways to develop my own math skills was to spend a long time with one problem, but the pacing of 70 currently makes that hard to do, especially if you don't have experience before. An accelerated class would satisfy those who do have experience. With the budget as it is, I don't see this happening any time soon though.\\n\\nOn a side note, many TAs might lack significant teaching experience, and therefore lack certain qualities that you mentioned. I think it's important to realize that some TAs are going to be undergrads not much older and experienced than the students so mistakes (to some extent) are to be expected.

       "  \">The course is not equitable and heavily disadvantages minorities & lower-income students because they likely haven't taken rigorous math needed and are more likely to work during school.  \\n\\nFacts. It's actually insane how much of an advantage silicon valley kids (you know, the types that went to schools like Lynbrook, Monta Vista, Mission SJ, etc. etc.) have when it comes to a course like CS70. Most of these kids have had significant exposure to multivariable calc, LA, and other advanced math that while not directly applicable to CS70, has certainly had a profound impact on their mathematical maturity which is huge in a class graded on a relative curve like CS70. And that's not even including the easier access and greater opportunity these kids have when it comes to pursuing competition math (AMC, AIME, etc. etc.). Many of low income friends in CS/EECS have stated that they were lucky to even have AP Calc AB (Calc 1) offered in high school. \\n\\nI hope your post gets the necessary traction and spotlight deserves. CS70 is by far the most unequitable CS class at Berkeley, which is a real shame. Considering that courses like 61A have made large strides to level the playing field (precursor classes like CS10, etc etc.) , I have optimism that the situation regarding 70 can and will be improved.  \\n\\nExcellent write-up, OP.\",\n",

In fact I would imagine it‚Äôs significantly smaller if we‚Äôre considering everything, because for a substantial amount of students CS61A is their first time ever coding, whereas CS70 is certainly not their first exposure to math. Additionally, many recommend taking courses such as the EECS16 series and Math 53 in order to prepare for CS70. This preparation simply doesn‚Äôt exist for the 61 series as the only courses available are CS 10 and Data C8, which simply do not come near the rigor of the CS61 series.\\n‚ÄúAn overwhelming majority of students will tell you that lecture is useless‚Äù \\nAnd an overwhelming majority of students struggle in CS70. As someone who went to essentially every lecture, I can assure you a large portion of students did not go at all, however the people that I know that did go (granted this is anecdotal), ended up doing well in the course. I would love to see data on this, and of course this is just speculation, but I guarantee there‚Äôs a positive correlation between lecture attendance and grades. \\n\\n‚ÄúI have spent approximately 900 hours‚Äù\\n\\nI‚Äôm sorry but this is just absurd. There just exists diminishing returns in studying and it simply does not make sense to be spending this much time. Not all studying is created equally, and I highly encourage you to reach out to peers that did well and see what their strategy is and adapt your study habits.\\n \\nThis one is two quotes \\n‚ÄúFor students who don‚Äôt have time to spare‚Äù \\n‚ÄúWhy offer a no-homework option‚Äù\\nYou critique CS70 through Tarang with past exams not including enough walkthroughs on the solutions. First off I think I agree with this philosophy of not just handing out the answers to students, and the person that convinced me was Professor Adikhari who designed Prob 140, and is an incredible professor. When you have difficult topics like Discrete Math and Probability Theory, all the learning comes through struggling and developing your own problem solving techniques. Seeing the answer just simply restricts your ability to learn. And I think the no-hw option exists purely for the reason of being accommodating. \\n\\n‚Äú61AB has a plethora of resources‚Äù\\n\\nI have to hard disagree with this. In office hours for CS61B it was extremely common for people to wait for 3 hours absolutely stuck on a bug, only to get 3 minutes with a TA that gave them the completely wrong advice. That simply doesn‚Äôt exist in CS70 where there isn‚Äôt the same existence of getting stuck on a bug, and there is always quick response times in office hours (legit the few times I went I was the only one haha).\\n\\nOverall, I think CS70 is difficult because 1) people do not take the proper prep courses to gain that ‚Äúmathematical maturity‚Äù (cringe term but true) and 2) because you just simply can‚Äôt half ass it like CS61 series where you can just spend a couple days grinding practice exams (61A) or projects (61B/C).

He loved programming and built up those skills on the side because at the time he didn\\'t know he would want to make it a career and business seemed more lucrative.  When he graduated, he decided to try his hand at programming jobs. He had to hustle a little bit in his first couple of years, but 12 years later, he is extremely successful, loves his job, and is contacted by recruiters all the time.  Another friend majored in ART, but always liked computers/digital stuff and he easily retrained with a few cc/extension courses and landed a really sweet job in front-end development/UX that pays him well and that he loves.\\n\\nMy point here is that many of you have been raised in a culture that is extremely competitive and cutthroat, and you are at BERKELEY, which is a very competitive place.

So for those posts that are disrespectful to you, I would like to ask if you would please forgive our behavior.\\xa0  \\nOn a separate note... if possible, I hope that you or the TAs could offer extra exam review videos/sessions or other resources for the next class. It was quite tough finding what concepts I was missing for exam review. If there was just something that glossed over every topic, variable, and formula the class covered it would be really helpful to be able to pinpoint what we still need to review.\\xa0\"',\n",

Professors can have different ideas about what will lead to maximum student and societal benefit depending on their teaching philosophies. Some professors will cut you some slack, and some won\\'t.

If you have strong a mathematics maturity, such as be accustomed to formal proofs or  rationalizing some science stuffs in the past. It shouldn't be that bad. However, if you didn't, don't worry. Just try your best to read all notes before attending lectures. I could say if you could write out any proof in the notes. You are fine with this kind of abstract thinking.\\n2. Lectures cover material in very abstract ways, but the homework really helps you to get familiar with everything in depths. Personally speaking, I found lectures not quite helpful. It's basically reiteration of the notes, but sometimes oversimplifying the nuances of the beauty of this course. So, my suggestion is to spend more time on homework individually. It's completely a different experience from discussing them with classmates because sometimes on the exam you don't have that many collective ideas.\\n3. Exams in summer are much more friendly than in normal semesters. Just practice and train yourself to speed up. It's somehow different from homework because exams usually emphasize on the range of materials and therefore don't have many sophisticated thinking like homework do. Usually, 1 std + on midterm and final guarantees an A and the averages corresponds to B (or B+, a little bit unsure).\",\n",

I do not speak for the EECS department, campus or anyone else.  \\n>  \\n>UC Berkeley\\'s electrical engineering and computer sciences department is trapped in a campus that underfunds undergraduate education but also demands that the department accommodate a huge growth in demand. Ten years ago, the department graduated roughly 400 students with Bachelor\\'s degrees in EECS or computer science. This year, the number will probably be 1400, or roughly 15%, of all undergraduates.  \\n>  \\n>A department that has privately tried to hold things together throughout a decade of unprecedented growth now lacks the funds to teach at scale and has to take unilateral action. Thus, for example, CS 70 (a class needed to declare Letters and Science CS), is almost certainly going to be limited to those who were admitted as intending to do CS starting in fall 2022.  \\n>  \\n>The fundamental problem starts with a campus that deliberately underfunds undergraduate education. The campus provides departments such as EECS with a budget of slightly more than $50 per student-credit per hour to pay for both lecturers and TAs. A student in a 4-unit class contributes roughly $200 out of the student\\'s overall tuition for these expenses. Yet the actual cost to a department is more than $350 per student for that 4-unit class, forcing departments to find additional funds to cover the upward of $150 per student gap.  \\n>  \\n>At this point the EECS department is running an annual deficit of nearly $5 million, and cutting this requires drastically cutting enrollment in CS classes. But the deficit is in many ways an excuse to do what needs to be done as no other major campus teaches at this seemingly impossible scale.  \\n>  \\n>We stumbled our way into handling the demand by scaling class resources using undergraduate TAs. We can maintain a pipeline of students who first take the class; then serve as a reader or tutor; then as a TA for multiple semesters. But this pipeline works only if a class is taught every semester.  \\n>  \\n>This technique has allowed classes, such as CS 161, CS 188, and other to each support more than 1,000 students a year.  \\n>  \\n>If we lose one of these classes for a single semester ‚Äî as might happen soon ‚Äî this disrupts the talent pipeline. Now the class changes from one that can support 1,000 students a year to one that can support perhaps 300 as the undergraduate talent pipeline evaporates. Losing just a single one of these scaled classes will be a disaster since the department must provide more than 7,000 student-seats per year in the upper division courses. It will create a situation where there are simply not enough classroom seats for our existing majors to meet graduation requirements.  \\n>  \\n>Repeatedly teaching the same class in order to maintain the pipeline is a recipe for faculty burnout and, without campus support, a thankless task. Dropping the student population by more than 50% would eliminate the need to maintain the teaching pipeline for so many classes, allowing the department to safely offer many of these classes only once a year rather than every semester.  \\n>  \\n>The department tried to convince Letters and Science to shift to a freshman admission model for CS in order to control the size of the major. Letters and Science rejected it. Thus it is highly likely that CS 70, a class necessary to declare the CS major, will be restricted starting in fall 2022 to only the students who actually listed CS or EECS as their intended major, cutting through the backdoor a major that Letters and Science refuses to allow the department to control earlier in the pipeline.  \\n>  \\n>And if this proposal is somehow circumvented or rejected by Letters and Science, it would be natural to restrict CS 70 to \"declared EECS and Letters and Science students only\" in 2023 ‚Äîand, since a student can\\'t declare in Letters and Science until they take CS 70 first, will kill the Letters and Science major entirely.  \\n>  \\n>The money is no doubt a concern. But even if campus would fund the department\\'s teaching (in the end it would cost less than $5million a year, or half of the stadium debt payments that campus took over from the athletic department), the department is still in danger of shattering just due to demand.  \\n>  \\n>In an ideal world, the EECS department would teach all those at UC Berkeley who want to pursue CS. But that would require explicit campus support ‚Äî not only a substantially higher amount of Temporary Academic Staff funding to eliminate the department\\'s deficit but also a willingness to provide more faculty slots to enable the EECS department to grow with the demand. As a department, our student/faculty ratio is three times worse than comparable institutions.  \\n>  \\n>Without this support, the number of students has to be drastically cut simply to avoid the even worse outcome of an upper division class failing.  \\n>  \\n>*Nicholas Weaver is a soon-to-be former lecturer in computer science at UC Berkeley.*\\n\\nEDIT: Apparently Reddit\\'s \"Fancy Pants Editor\" doesn\\'t work so good, and deleted part of the transcription.',\n",

Ultimately if we want the economy to recover well, it won‚Äôt be because we move to a fully service oriented economy but because our manufacturers and other industries become more competitive.\\n\\nAs athletics and other traditional methods of funding wane, a massive college of ‚Äúdata‚Äù is a good way to grow the school.

That way, EECS could remain at its current size and still have quality classes and opportunities without suffering so much of a funding issue for great, relevant courses on the EE side (though realistically this announcement means some CS upper divs like 168 or 172 will likely be offered less as those professors are asked instead to reach thousand person data and networks classes).\\n\\nHowever my hot take is that there are more students looking for EE intensive curriculum and not getting it than those who are underserved in the cs material that will be cut, just because the 5th year ms, tons of research labs and other opportunities around campus still help those students compete at the highest level internationally.',\n",

Even those of you not interested in 120 might have felt the pinch‚Äîin your attempt to register for other courses‚Äîof what I‚Äôm about to describe.\\n> \\n> For the first time in my sixteen years at Berkeley I‚Äôm forced into the heartrending situation of having to curb enrollment in a course that I love‚ÄîEE 120.  In fact, I might even have to reduce the enrollment size down from its current level.\\n> \\n> The TAS budget (the money we get from the campus to fund the hiring of TAs and Readers) seems to have shrunk across the board, to the point where in EE 120 alone I cannot assemble the team I need.  An absolute red line for me‚Äîone that I will not cross‚Äîis overworking my TAs beyond their appointment limits. Aside from the far, far, far greater moral/ethical abomination of overworking members of my staff, it can also trigger legal conflict with the Union.\\n> \\n> Last I checked, in the spring offering of EE 120 I have about 110 students enrolled, and about 40 students on the waiting list.  To be clear, the bottleneck is NOT room capacity.  The classroom assigned to me houses 149 students.  The bottleneck is my anemic TA budget.  I can‚Äôt hire the staff I need to deliver, to that large a class size, the quality I‚Äôm used to providing.\\n> \\n> In the coming days, I‚Äôll try to tinker with the budget and the TA applicant pool in all the permutations that my 7th-grade can think of, to see if I can find a creative solution.  But the prospects of even keeping the current enrollment size‚Äîlet alone expanding it‚Äîremain bleak.\\n> \\n> Some of you can help in the following way.  If you took EE 120 and did well (A or A+), your overall GPA is up there, and you‚Äôre willing to take an 8-hour TA appointment, do let me know right away, and go online and apply for a position, so I can see you in the database. If you got A-, B+, or B in EE 120, but subsequently took EE 123 or EE 126 and received an A or better, I‚Äôm more than happy to talk with you.\\n> \\n> As an undergraduate at Caltech, I went into the final exam of my second term of Signals and Systems holding a solid A. But I bombed the final and landed on a B+. I know stuff like that happens. But subsequent courses provide second and third chances. I made virtually a career of teaching this material. So, talk to me if you have a passion for teaching the subject.\\n> \\n> Those of you already on the waiting list for the course can feel free to stay on it, But, please, don‚Äôt wait at the expense of other opportunities that may come your way.  I don‚Äôt want you to sacrifice the chance at getting into another worthwhile course while you wait for what appears now as an unlikely opening in EE 120.\\n> \\n> I‚Äôm deeply saddened at the mere thought of turning students away from a course with which I have a strong, longstanding sentimental bond. I‚Äôve been teaching EE 120 fairly regularly since spring 2006, and previously its counterpart at MIT‚Äîboith as a graduate student and a visiting faculty member on sabbatical.  I love to teach this subject to as wide an audience as possible.\\n> \\n> I haven‚Äôt seen this level of interest in EE 120 since about 2012.  So, it‚Äôs a shame that I can‚Äôt enjoy the lovely company of those among you who want to go through the Signals-and-Systems journey with me next spring, but are stuck on the waiting list or outside it altogether.\\n> \\n> Please forgive me.\\n> \\n> Babak.\\n\\n---\\n> Hi folks,\\n> \\n> I thank you for your support and understanding.\\n> \\n> To be clear, I did not want to give the impression that I don‚Äôt have a TA budget. My problem is that I have an insufficient budget.\\n> \\n> For example, I have a star candidate who has TA‚Äôed for me before, and is well-versed with the labs of the course. But he happens to be a 5th-Year Master‚Äôs student, and they cost $3K more than a PhD student, for example!!!\\n> \\n> If I want to hire him and a PhD student each at 20 hours a week, I go close to $2K into the red with my budget. So, forget about hiring readers! (See the screenshot below ‚Ä¶ as an exercise, try to notice other anomalies in the cost structure).\\n> \\n> That‚Äôs sort of problem I have.\\n> \\n> To salvage this, I need a number of 8-hour undergrad TAs who can shine.\\n> \\n> As for recording the lectures, in the past I‚Äôve gotten a budget from the Department‚Äîseparate from the TA budget‚Äîto do this. I hope I can get it again. But if all else fails, I‚Äôll look for volunteers who are willing to manage a camera in the classroom.\\n> \\n> Warm regards,\\n> \\n> Babak.',\n",

       "  'The way that adjunct faculty are treated by the campus is not fair, which is a campus wide issue, and not something peculiar to the College of Engineering or the College of Letters and Sciences.  Further more, it is a nation-wide issue throughout academia, and that is something I have great sympathy for.  There should be more done to honor the work done by lecturers and to compensate them appropriately, and I would support the campus putting more pressure on the Academic Senate to change its rules on tenure and to amend its expectations to favor people who do more undergraduate education and less research.  \\n\\nComplaints about having to teach the same courses year after year I find I have less of an ear for.  On the contrary, teaching the same course every year allows one to hone techniques, resources, and one\\'s pedagogy to become a better educator and teacher over time.  It also means one does not have to reinvent the wheel every semester or year, which can help.  It has been my experience that forcing educators to switch topics of instruction on a yearly basis has the opposite affect that you describe.  This could be a matter of opinion though, and am open to the idea that we all have different preferences in our work patterns.\\n\\nYour tone is hyperbolic.  \"Catastrophe\" and \"crisis\" are highly emotionally charged claims, ones that do not bear out.  It is natural that caps and limits will have to be placed on courses, that happens all the time across the campus.  There are not unlimited resources to be given to each department for their desires.  You have a history of complaining loudly about campus spending on student life on campus, but you should well know that there is more than one department on the campus and more than one department who\\'s needs need to be met.  More than 1400 students are affected by the activities and and events that take place at Memorial Stadium and thousands more alumni, community members, high schoolers, and visitors from out of state utilize and interact with the campus because of that venue and the myriad of events that take place there, sports being just one of them.\\n\\nAs always, your complaints are misplaced.  The state is where you should lodge your complaints.  It is the state government that has continued to demand that UC enlarge its enrollments at Cal and UCLA especially, even over the lack of housing, faculty, and resources to support them.  It is the state government that continues to underfund education (both K-12 and higher education) and expects miracles to be performed on a shoestring budget.  It is the state that stopped the campus from staying the gargantuan size it already is, and passed a law overriding a court ruling which would have capped the growth of the campus.  In the past decade the campus has grown by 10,000 students as higher demand from parents and students comes for more college degrees.  With the Baby Boom generation, UC expanded from a northern and southern campus to opening six more across the state.  In the past 50 years, despite larger and larger numbers of students entering college, only one new campus has been opened, and it is far smaller than its 8 other sisters (Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, and Riverside could all do with expansion as well).  Such issues need to be handled at the state level and the UC system level if things are to be properly addressed.  Cal cannot continue to grow, but that is the expectation that both Sacramento and Oakland have placed upon it.  The campus administration can only do what it can when given that box to work within, and its choices are limited.',\n",

It's okay to compare yourself to other people and strive to be as smart or as good (or as whatever) as them, but don't push it so hard that you have a mental breakdown.

Smart efficient people use office hours to be smarter and more efficient. \\n\\nIf i were you, i‚Äôd find something to drop, and enjoy some free time once in a while.

Unfortunately, a consequence of this is that such people are often hesitant to speak up, and as a result you can feel that you\\'re the only one struggling because most of the others in the group who are dealing with the same things you are aren\\'t talking as much.\\n\\nYour performance in 70 and 170 aren\\'t what will determine your future and your career (unless you intend to go into theory research or something).

Whichever path you take in your school and beyond, I hope you find a path that brings you satisfaction and a welcoming community.\\n\\nI do agree that there probably could be more done with respect to making 70 and 170 a bit less intimidating.\\n\\nThe programming classes are designed in such a way that there are multiple \"on-ramps\" depending on your prior exposure to CS concepts. People who are confident in their abilities and/or have prior exposure to the subject can hop right into 61A, while CS8 and Data 100 give people some more time to get some intuition and familiarity with the ideas before starting the fast-paced (and high-stakes, for people who need to pass a GPA class) classes.\\n\\nHowever, for 70, there\\'s no such universally agreed-on and recommended precursor class; everyone is thrown into the deep end by the second or third week of class, so people like OP end up being put on the same curve as people who have seen 70% of the material before.

       "  'About the CS70 notes, I think the ability to read mathematical texts is fundamentally a learned skill. If you came from a background where a lot of the math you learned was from texts, you are trained to be able to follow very terse writing and solution \"outlines\" that skip steps. Anyone who\\'s done high school math contests or read a college math textbook (ahem, Rudin) knows it\\'s so common practice to have books just skip steps and leave the rest as an exercise to the reader that it\\'s literally a meme. But think about this, I bet most kids in high school have less read than 20 pages of a math textbook in THEIR LIFE. They aren\\'t used to reading the terse language that math (also cs theory and physics textbooks \\\\*cough Jackson electrodynamics\\\\*) authors usually write in. When you read a math text, it\\'s not enough to just read the words there you have to follow their argument at a fundamental level in your head and this is just a skill that needs to be learned that one that you def do not get from just reading fiction in your normal high school.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR if you never read math textbooks in high school you\\'ll think CS70 notes are not readable. If you have read many math textbooks in high school then be very used to the terse language that the CS70 notes are written in. Sadly 70 notes are written by math people for math people.',\n",

Certain math classes have course notes that are truly dog shit and makes the notes for 70 look incredibly well written and well laid out. Every con of cs70 notes is exacerbated 10X in these notes and makes a truly horrendous learning experience',\n",
       "  'This is a terrible take painted over with an attempt to sound reasonable. It boils down to the idea that Berkeley CS should be incredibly difficult and exclusive.\\n\\nI‚Äôve worked in Silicon Valley for a few years now, at companies that this subreddit drools over. Newsflash, this shit is way easier than school. And many of my smartest colleagues did not go to Berkeley. They went to the ‚Äúother‚Äù schools that this OP implicitly turns their nose at. I haven‚Äôt used discrete math and probability in ages.\\n\\nOP believes that the Berkeley CS education should only be for high school kids that want to chase a PhD in theoretical computer science. But real life is so different than that small bubble. The work is challenging but it‚Äôs nothing like school. And more importantly, the work is financially rewarding, which is extremely important for those not born into wealth and privilege. So why on Earth would we want to make already irrelevant courses harder for students that need to chase big bags to help secure their financial roots?\\n\\nThe end result is that promising kids that could have totally succeeded in the industry end up washing out because idiots (yes, hot take, idiots) like Sahai and others glorify this ultratraditionalist thinking of grinding hundreds of hours in esoteric topics. It‚Äôs not. The software engineering industry is an amazing place to be right now. For many, it‚Äôs the new American dream. And people like OP and a subset of the CS department want to gatekeep people out of these life changing salaries so they can continue bragging about how smart they are.\\n\\nIf you want rigor there are plenty of 200-level courses to take. Stop sweating out smart 19 year olds, it‚Äôs essentially hazing at this point.\\n\\nTruth is, I‚Äôd be extremely happy to hire the 900 hours person. They have a good head on their shoulders.

But why can‚Äôt steps be taken to help students who don‚Äôt have that experience? Of course some students would feel less challenged if the class was split up into two classes, or had an optional precursor class, or covered less content, or whatever. But why isn‚Äôt the most important thing that people actually enjoy the class and end up learning the material? Why shouldn‚Äôt the notes be color-coded just because it doesn‚Äôt make a difference to you? Why should OP just transfer/change majors because one course took a lot of time and effort for them? Why is this nebulous concept of ‚Äúrigor‚Äù the most important thing to you? \\n\\nClearly the OP wasn‚Äôt the only person who feels this way about 70, but you are acting like these are all just individual problems rather than a systemic issue with how the course is taught.

       "  'As a graduate and currently a graduate student I can say i enjoyed the rigor but it didnt need to be that difficult tbh lol  \\nCal can only do one thing regarding to competing with top universities and thats rigor. Cal doesnt offer a whole lot of resources when it comes to their courses which forces the students to really hone in on the subjects. I dont think thats the proper way to teach but who am I to say what the proper way is but I am doing much better at Stanford and my stress levels are way more maintainable.   \\nTo say dont do CS at Cal if youre interested in being physically and mentally healthy is the problem with Cal. I do believe they need to relax because every year i was at cal there were 3-6 suicides, one of them being a friend of mine. To say the institution is not to blame for the amount of stress crippling people is absurd. I survived but my friend didnt and I wouldve loved to share my graduate experience with him (he wanted to come to stanford too). Much love for anyone going through it rn at Cal, if you need help or anything reach out to me or a friend or the therapists at the campus medical building by RSF i forgot the name of it sorry. I burned out bc of cal and it wasnt needed. Once working I kind of resented Cal because i was like really? all of that just so i could do this? but i found its better to help fellow bears feeling lost and thats made the resentment go away bc we all are Cal and if I can help a student out then im helping Cal be better.   \\nI understand how youre feeling because I felt that way when I was going through it but that changed when i lost my friend. He was smart af and I cant even imagine all the things that he couldve done after graduating. its sad but hopefully me sharing this with you maybe makes you help the ones who are struggling. Teaching someone is just as much studying as studying traditionally is and you get the reward of helping someone out. Plus my CS70 professor encouraged us to teach each other even though it seems i was the only one doing it lol \\n\\n  \\nI really wish you the best and I hope you find some kernels of good in this comment bc it comes from the heart. I think CS at Cal would be easier if we helped one another more because at Stanford we have tons of help readily available.
